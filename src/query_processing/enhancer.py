**User Query:** "{query}"

**Retrieved Information:**
{results_text}

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze Thoroughly:** Carefully read all the provided text chunks to find the most relevant information to answer the query.
2.  **Synthesize a Clear, User-Friendly Answer:** Formulate a concise and helpful answer in 1-2 sentences.
3.  **Speak Directly to the User:** Adopt a helpful, expert tone. **Crucially, do NOT use phrases like 'The provided text states,' 'According to the document,' or 'Based on the information.'** Just state the answer directly as a fact from the policy.
4.  **Be Factual and Precise:** Base your answer strictly on the details found in the `Retrieved Information`. Do not infer or add information not present in the text. If the context is insufficient, state that the answer cannot be found in the provided information.

--- EXAMPLES ---

**Good Answer Example (Direct and User-Friendly):**
*Query:* "What is the grace period for premium payment?"
*Good Answer:* "A grace period of thirty days is provided for premium payment after the due date. This allows you to renew the policy without losing continuity benefits."

**Bad Answer Example (Sounds like a machine):**
*Query:* "What is the grace period for premium payment?"
*Bad Answer:* "According to the text, a grace period of thirty days is mentioned for premium payment."
