He considers the motion of a body moving in equal, successive time intervals. Initially, suppose the body, by its innate force, describes a straight line segment (e.g., line AB) in the first equal time interval.\n\n2. In the next equal time interval, if no force acted, it would continue along a straight line (e.g., line Be). However, at the instant it reaches the end of this segment (point B), a centripetal force acts with a sudden impulse, \"turning aside the body from the right line Be\" and compelling it to move along a new straight line (BC).\n\n3. By constructing triangles with the centre of force and these points (e.g., triangles ASB, BSC, etc.), Newton shows that the areas of these triangles are equal since the force acts towards the centre and the constructed lines are parallel in a certain manner. In particular, the triangle corresponding to each successive small time interval is equal in area to the preceding one.\n\n4. Repeating this argument for successive small time intervals, this implies that in equal times, the equal areas are described by the radius vector drawn from the central force to the moving body.\n\n5. These equal areas lie in one single immovable plane; thus, the body\u2019s motion is planar, and the area swept out by the radius vector is proportional to the elapsed time.\n\n6. Newton justifies this using his First Law (a body remains in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force) and Corollary I of the Laws of Motion that an impulse changes the motion direction instantly but not the magnitude of the velocity in the tangent direction.\n\n7. He further resolves the central force into two components: one along the tangent to the orbit, affecting speed, and one perpendicular to the tangent (the centripetal force), which changes the direction but not the speed. Hence, the motion is always deflected towards the centre without altering the speed component along the path in a way that would violate equal-area proportions.\n\nThis reasoning rigorously establishes that a central force acting continuously towards a fixed point causes a body to sweep out areas proportional to time, thus proving Kepler's Second Law purely from Newton's laws of motion and the existence of a centripetal force directed to the centre.\n\nAdditionally, Newton\u2019s method relies on considering the limit as the time intervals become vanishingly small (\"the sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities\"), thereby using a geometrical limit approach equivalent to the method of indivisibles but more rigorous.\n\nIn summary, Newton derives Kepler\u2019s Second Law by showing that the centripetal force continuously acting toward the centre deflects the body's path in such a way that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times, in accordance with his laws of motion and the principle of centripetal forces."]}

However, it does not explicitly define car theft or the specific kind of case (e.g., criminal offence category) it constitutes.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the given text, it cannot be determined under which exact legal case or classification a stolen car falls.", "No, arrest without a warrant is not per se illegal but is subject to strict constitutional safeguards: \"No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" Furthermore, every arrested person must be produced before the nearest magistrate within twenty-four hours of arrest, excluding travel time, and cannot be detained beyond that period without magistrate authorization. Exceptions apply only to enemy aliens or those arrested or detained under laws providing for preventive detention, which have their own specific procedural safeguards. Thus, an arrest without a warrant is only legal if it complies with these procedural protections and constitutional provisions; arbitrary or secret arrest and detention are not permitted.", "Denying a job to someone solely because of their caste is not allowed. The Constitution of India explicitly prohibits discrimination on grounds of caste in employment under Article 15 and Article 16. Article 15(1) states that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Article 16(2) provides that no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, or place of birth be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.\n\nAdditionally, Article 17 abolishes \"Untouchability\" and forbids its practice in any form, making enforcement of any disability arising out of \"Untouchability\" an offence punishable by law.\n\nTherefore, a denial of employment solely on the basis of caste constitutes prohibited discrimination. Furthermore, the State may make provisions for reservations in appointments or posts for backward classes, but that does not justify unlawful caste-based denial of jobs to others.\n\nIf caste discrimination occurs, there is a National Commission for Scheduled Castes (Article 338) empowered to investigate complaints and enforce protections relating to Scheduled Castes.\n\nIn summary: It is constitutionally forbidden to deny someone a job solely for their caste, and such caste-based discrimination in employment is unlawful and punishable.", "The Constitution of India, specifically under Article 31A and Article 31B (relating to the Ninth Schedule), provides that laws enabling the State to acquire any estate or rights therein, or enabling compulsory acquisition of property, are not void even if they abrogate or take away rights otherwise guaranteed under fundamental rights. Such Acts and regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule continue in force notwithstanding any judgment, decree, or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary.\n\nFurthermore, the State is permitted to acquire land compulsorily, including estates or rights in land, and any such law providing for acquisition or extinguishment of rights is protected from being declared void under the Constitution.\n\nThere is a proviso that where any law provides for acquisition by the State of any land personally cultivated by a person, it is not lawful for the State to acquire any portion of such land within the ceiling limit without providing compensation not less than the market value.\n\nIn addition, any acquisition made under specific State tenancy laws that contravene constitutional provisions (e.g., Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, contrary to article 31A(1)) shall be void to the extent of the contravention.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does not explicitly grant individual landowners a fundamental right to stop or prevent government acquisition of land once the acquisition process is legally set in motion under these laws. Laws providing for acquisition are saved from being declared unconstitutional, thereby limiting the ability to oppose such acquisition on constitutional grounds.\n\nNo information in the text indicates a direct right or procedure for an individual to stop or prevent the government from acquiring land for a project once the legal acquisition process is followed as per the constitutional provisions and laws under the Ninth Schedule.\n\nTherefore, if the government takes your land for a project under the prescribed acquisition laws, you generally cannot stop it, provided the acquisition is in accordance with the law. You may be entitled to compensation at or above market value, especially if the land is personally cultivated and falls within the ceiling limits, but the text does not provide a right to legally prevent the acquisition itself.", "It is illegal for a child below the age of fourteen years to be employed to work in any factory, mine, or engaged in any other hazardous employment.

Therefore, if a child is forced to work in a factory, it violates these constitutional protections and is not legal.", "You have the right to freedom of speech and expression as a citizen under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. This includes the right to speak at protests. However, this right is subject to \"reasonable restrictions\" imposed by the State in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order, or morality (Article 19(2)). Therefore, the State may lawfully restrict or prevent speech at a protest if it does so through such reasonable restrictions aimed at maintaining public order or other specified interests. If you are stopped from speaking at a protest without a lawful basis under these reasonable restrictions, it would be against your constitutional rights. Remedies for enforcement of these rights are available through appropriate proceedings in the Supreme Court or other courts empowered by Parliament (Article 32). In summary, speaking at a protest is your right, but it can be restricted by law in the interests of public order or other permissible grounds.", "The Constitution guarantees \"equality before the law\" and \"equal protection of the laws\" to every person within the territory of India (Article 14). It prohibits the State from discriminating against citizens on grounds including sex (Article 15(1)) and from subjecting any citizen to disability, liability, restriction, or condition on such grounds (Article 15(2)). However, Article 15(3) explicitly allows the State to make special provisions for women and children.\n\nAt the same time, Article 25 grants every person \"freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject to public order, morality, and health. Article 26 confers on every religious denomination or any section thereof the right \"to manage its own affairs in matters of religion.\"\n\nThus, while fundamental rights protect against sex-based discrimination generally, religion enjoys a degree of autonomy to manage its religious affairs, which may include regulating entry into religious places. There is a state power to regulate or restrict activities associated with religious practice under public order, morality, and health considerations, but the text does not explicitly resolve the conflict where entry is denied to women purely on religious grounds.\n\nNo specific provision or judicial interpretation is detailed in the text addressing whether gender-based exclusion of women from religious places is unconstitutional. The Constitution balances the right to equality with religious freedom and management of religious affairs, but it also permits the State to make laws \"providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus\" (Article 25(2)(b)).\n\nIn conclusion, based solely on the provided text, denying entry to a woman into a religious place because she is a woman implicates a complex interplay between the right to equality (Articles 14 and 15) and the freedom of religion and religious denomination autonomy (Articles 25 and 26). The Constitution prohibits sex discrimination by the State but also protects religious denominations\u2019 rights to manage their affairs. Whether such exclusion by a religious place is constitutional is not explicitly settled in the text and would depend on judicial interpretation balancing these rights.", "Under Article 25 of the Constitution, all persons are \"equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject only to \"public order, morality and health\" and other provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, if you change your religion, the government cannot stop you from freely professing your new religion except insofar as it may impose reasonable restrictions related to public order, morality, or health. There is no provision authorizing the State to prevent a person from changing their religion or to prohibit the free profession of a religion of their choice.", "If the police torture someone in custody, the right being violated is the \"Protection of life and personal liberty\" under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which states: \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\" Torture in custody infringes upon this protection because it unlawfully deprives a person of personal liberty and bodily integrity.\n\nAdditionally, related protections include those against illegal detention and the right to be produced before a magistrate within twenty-four hours as per Article 22, which safeguards against custodial abuses.\n\nThus, police torture in custody violates the fundamental right under Article 21\u2014the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution.", "If you are denied admission to a public educational institution on grounds of belonging to a socially and educationally backward community, you have legal protections and recourse under the Constitution of India:\n\n1. The State is empowered to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, including reservations in admission to educational institutions, except for minority institutions referred to in Article 30(1). Such reservations and special provisions are constitutionally provided for under Articles 15(4) and 15(5), allowing the State to make laws favoring backward classes for admission purposes.\n\n2. Article 16(4) permits the State to make provisions for reservation in public employment for any backward class of citizens not adequately represented, a principle analogous in educational admissions.\n\n3. Article 19(1)(g) guarantees the right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business, and enforcement of fundamental rights, including equality and non-discrimination, can be sought through appropriate legal proceedings under Article 32, which allows the Supreme Court to issue writs such as mandamus to enforce rights.\n\n4. Article 29(2) explicitly states that \"No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.\" This prohibits denial of admission purely on community grounds except where affirmative action applies.\n\n5. The socially and educationally backward classes are identified and maintained in the Central List by the President in consultation with the Governor and by law, enabling the reservation framework.\n\n6. If you are denied admission improperly because of your community status, you may challenge the decision by moving the Supreme Court or appropriate High Court under Article 32 or Article 226 respectively, by filing a writ petition for enforcement of your constitutional rights.\n\nIn summary, if denied admission due to belonging to a backward community, you can seek judicial remedies under constitutional provisions guaranteeing equality, affirmative action for backward classes, and protection against discrimination. The courts have the power to issue writs such as mandamus directing admission if you are wrongfully denied."]}

For example, a body double in quantity with equal velocity has double the quantity of motion, and with twice the velocity, it has quadruple the quantity of motion.\n\nIn contrast, Newton defines \"force\" as an impressed action exerted upon a body \"in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line.\" He further distinguishes different kinds of force, including the \"vis insita\" or innate force of matter (vis inertia), which is a power of resisting change of state, existing in the body to maintain its present state of rest or uniform motion. This innate force is proportional to the mass of the body and differs from the inactivity of mass only in conceptualization.\n\nAn impressed force is an external action that changes a body's state of motion; it \"consists in the action only, and remains no longer in the body when the action is over.\" Forces such as centripetal force tend to draw bodies toward a point or center.\n\nThus, the \"quantity of motion\" is a quantitative measure depending on both mass and velocity and represents the motion possessed by the body, whereas \"force\" is an external agency or power impressed on bodies to induce change in their state of motion. Forces cause changes in the quantity of motion, but the quantity of motion itself is a property of the moving body, not a force.\n\nMoreover, Newton's laws imply that the quantity of motion is conserved in interactions among bodies (sum of motions directed to the same parts, or difference when directed oppositely, remains unchanged by their mutual actions), while forces are agents that produce changes in motions.\n\nIn summary, \"quantity of motion\" is the product of mass and velocity measuring the body's motion, whereas \"force\" is the impressed action causing changes in that motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are:\n\n1. **Law I:** \"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\" This means a body maintains its motion or rest unless acted upon by an external force. For example, projectiles continue their motions unless retarded by air resistance or pulled down by gravity. Larger celestial bodies like planets and comets move with less resistance in space and thus maintain their motions\u2014both straight and circular\u2014for much longer.\n\n2. **Law II:** \"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\" The change in motion (acceleration) is proportional to the applied force and occurs along the direction of that force. Doubling the force doubles the motion change, tripling triples it, regardless of whether the force acts all at once or gradually.\n\n3. **Law III:** (Though not fully stated in the retrieved text, implied) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\u2014this is evident in discussions about mutual attractions and impulses between bodies.\n\n**Application in celestial mechanics:**\n\n- Celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and comets move in space \"free and void of resistance,\" enabling them to perpetuate their motions as governed by these laws, chiefly Law I (inertia).\n\n- The motions of celestial bodies are explained by these laws together with the law of universal gravitation: every particle of matter attracts every other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\n- Law II is applied in quantifying how gravitational forces alter the motions of planets and satellites; the acceleration of a body towards a center is proportional to the gravitational force impressed on it.\n\n- The motions of bodies in orbits (elliptical, parabolic, or circular) are resolved into components towards the center (centripetal forces) and transverse directions as per Law II, explaining the curved orbital paths.\n\n- Law I accounts for the persistence of these orbits in space absent resisting mediums like air.\n\n- Newton\u2019s laws, combined with universal gravitation, unify the observed motions of the moon, planets, satellites, and comets, explaining and harmonizing their diverse phenomena.\n\n- By these laws, the regular revolutions and positions of the orbits arise from the forces acting on the bodies; without them, bodies would continue in rectilinear paths.\n\n- Although celestial motions conform broadly to these laws, certain irregularities and inequalities (e.g., in lunar motions or nodal positions) are noted, indicating complexities beyond the immediate scope of the laws.\n\nIn sum, Newton\u2019s three laws of motion establish the fundamental principles governing the persistence of motion (inertia), the proportionality and directionality of change in motion due to forces, and reciprocal interactions, which collectively describe and predict the behavior of celestial bodies under the influence of universal gravitation in the resistance-free spaces of the heavens.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by starting from the observed motions of planets and applying Kepler\u2019s laws. He first infers that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is directed toward the sun and varies inversely as the square of its distance from the sun. He demonstrates that a planet acted upon by a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance must move in a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola), thereby linking the force law to the observed orbital shapes.\n\nNewton also establishes that this gravitational force resides in every particle of matter and that for spherical masses, it acts as if concentrated at their centers. Hence, one spherical body acts upon another with a force directly proportional to the product of their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nHe verifies this inverse-square dependency by comparing the motion of terrestrial bodies (falling bodies on Earth), the moon, and other celestial bodies, ultimately harmonizing all such motions into one general law. By reasoning that the force of gravity toward a planet arises from the sum of the forces toward all its particles, and using corollaries that relate the force of attraction to both masses and the inverse square of their separation, Newton mathematically derives the universal gravitational attraction formula.\n\nThus, through combining empirical evidence from planetary motions and rigorous mathematical propositions (including corollaries relating accelerating forces to distance squared), Newton proves that gravitational attraction between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.", "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act universally on all masses is grounded in the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Composition of Bodies and Mutual Gravitation:** A greater body, such as a planet, can be considered as formed of many lesser parts or particles, each exerting gravitational attraction. The total gravitational force exerted by the whole planet arises from the sum of the forces of gravity exerted by all its component parts. By Newton's third law (\"to every action corresponds an equal re-action\"), each part of one body attracts every part of another body, and each body attracts the other in proportion to its matter.\n\n2. **Universal Mutual Attraction:** Since all parts of a body mutually gravitate towards all parts of every other body, it follows logically that all bodies, celestial and terrestrial alike, must universally attract each other in proportion to their quantities of matter. This principle extends to particles and masses, from the minutest parts to the entire system of planets, satellites, and comets.\n\n3. **No Difference in Substance Among Bodies:** There is no fundamental difference in substance among bodies, only modes and forms, so the forces proportional to matter found in terrestrial bodies must be present in all bodies, including celestial ones.\n\n4. **Apparent Absence of Mutual Gravitation Among Small Bodies:** The objection that terrestrial bodies do not show noticeable mutual gravitation with each other is answered by the fact that the gravitation towards small bodies is negligible compared to the gravitation towards the Earth as a whole, and hence remains below sensory observation.\n\n5. **Empirical Confirmation:** Experiments and astronomical observations show all bodies gravitate mutually\u2014objects towards Earth proportionally to their matter, the Moon towards Earth, the sea towards the Moon, planets towards each other, and comets towards the Sun. Thus, by general induction and the rule that \"to the same natural effects we must assign the same causes,\" universal gravitation by all bodies necessarily follows.\n\n6. **Simplicity and Sufficiency of Cause:** Following the philosophical rule that nature does nothing in vain and prefers simplicity, no additional causes are needed beyond universal gravitation to explain observed motions and phenomena.\n\nIn summary, Newton's argument is a logical and experimental induction establishing that since attraction arises from parts and since all bodies behave consistently under gravity with forces proportional to matter, universal mutual gravitation is a necessary principle applying to all masses, celestial and terrestrial, regardless of size.", "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by considering the mutual \"accelerative attractions\" between bodies in the Solar System and the inequalities in these forces acting on different parts of the system. He shows that when bodies revolve in a system of two or more, the perturbation of their motions increases because the inclinations and inequalities of the lines (distances) drawn from a great body to other parts become greater.\n\nSpecifically, Newton states that if the accelerative forces acting on the parts of the system towards the greatest body were equal and reciprocally as the squares of their distances, no perturbation would result. However, the actual accelerative forces often differ unequally, especially if the inequality of the proportion of forces is greater than that of the distances. This unequal action causes perturbations, since the \"excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves.\"\n\nNewton applies this reasoning to planetary interactions, for example, the perturbation of Saturn's orbit by Jupiter. Although the force of gravity towards Jupiter is much smaller than that towards the Sun, because the distances of the planets relative to each other differ, the gravity of Saturn towards Jupiter during conjunction becomes significant enough to perturb Saturn's orbit noticeably, to the extent that astronomers are puzzled by these variations. Similarly, the perturbations of Jupiter's orbit by Saturn are smaller, and those of other planets are even less significant except for the Earth, which is sensibly disturbed by the Moon.\n\nNewton further explains that these perturbations can cause changes in the position of the planets within their orbits and can introduce perturbations not only in longitude but also in latitude, occasionally attracting a planet out of the plane of its orbit. He notes that the aphelions and nodes of the planetary orbits are theoretically fixed, but small inequalities arise from these mutual actions, though such effects are very small and often neglected in initial considerations.\n\nOverall, Newton's method involves analyzing the forces as accelerative attractions inversely proportional to the squares of distances, recognizing how unequal and inclined forces between multiple bodies create perturbations in their orbital motions. He demonstrates mathematically that the greater the discrepancy or inequality in these forces, the greater the perturbation, and that these combined mutual gravitational influences explain the complex motions observed in the Solar System beyond simple two-body dynamics.", "Newton used the concept of \"fluxions\" and \"fluents\" as the mathematical tools in Principia that were precursors to calculus. He invented the celebrated BINOMIAL THEOREM and applied it to rectification of curves, the determination of surfaces and solids, and the position of their centres of gravity. He considered quantities such as ordinates and abscissae as generated by motion\u2014lines by points, surfaces by lines, solids by surfaces\u2014and treated these as nascent quantities increasing by continual fluxion in proportion to time. From the equation of a curve, he deduced the velocities with which these quantities are generated, naming these velocities \"fluxions\" and the generated quantities \"fluents.\" This approach regarded increments as evanescent or nascent (momentaneous increments or moments), focusing on the limits of sums and ratios of these quantities rather than on finite particles.\n\nNewton did not use the standard calculus notation; instead, he presented his method in geometric terms and limited algebraic calculations when possible. He censured the handling of geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations and preferred the geometric or synthetic methods. The notation and algorithm of his fluxionary calculus were not published in Principia but appeared later, in 1693, in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works. Newton chose to reduce demonstrations to the \"first and last sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities,\" that is, to their limits, avoiding the method of indivisibles which he considered less geometrical and somewhat harsh. His demonstrations were framed in the style of the ancient geometers, emphasizing the rigor of limits rather than the algebraic symbolism developed by Leibniz.\n\nIn summary, Newton's Principia used fluxions and fluents grounded in geometric methods and infinite series expansions as precursors to calculus. He refrained from employing standard calculus notation because he valued geometric reasoning and rigor, found algebraic or symbolic methods less suitable for geometrical subjects, and intended to demonstrate the principles through limits of nascent and evanescent quantities rather than through formal differential symbols.", "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force as a general mathematical principle to explain orbital motion by describing it as a force \"directed towards some centre,\" which \"retains bodies in their orbits\" by continually drawing them toward that central point. This centripetal force counters the natural tendency of bodies to move away in straight lines at uniform motion. For example, a stone whirled in a sling endeavors to fly away tangentially due to its velocity, but the sling exerts a centripetal force directed to the hand, continually pulling the stone inward and retaining it in its orbit.\n\nApplying this concept to celestial bodies, Newton explains that planets and satellites revolve in orbits because there exists a centripetal force\u2014gravity\u2014that perpetually draws them aside from rectilinear motion into curved orbital paths. Without this force, bodies like the Moon would \"fly away\" tangentially rather than stay in orbit. If the centripetal force were too small, the body would not be turned sufficiently from a straight path; if too great, it would spiral inward.\n\nNewton distinguishes three measures of centripetal force: absolute, accelerative, and motive. The absolute force is the cause located at the center, the accelerative force is the energy diffused through space to move bodies, and the motive force is the body's propensity toward the center caused by these influences.\n\nHe further shows mathematically that the centripetal force holding a body in orbit varies according to the inverse square of the distance from the center (e.g., the sun), which aligns with the observed proportions of the orbital periods and distances of planets and satellites. By using this force law, he can calculate the precise force required to keep a body in a given orbit at a given velocity and conversely determine the orbit resulting from a given centripetal force.\n\nNewton\u2019s method involves idealizing the force with laws and proportions derived from astronomical observations and applying geometric and mathematical reasoning to relate areas swept by radii (representing orbits) to times, leading to conclusions about the nature and magnitude of the centripetal forces sustaining orbital motions.\n\nIn summary, Newton explains orbital motion by positing a centripetal force directed to the orbit\u2019s center that continuously draws a body away from straight-line motion into a curved path, with the force strength decreasing as the inverse square of the distance, enabling precise mathematical determination of orbital paths and velocities.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by treating the resistance as a force that retards the motion of bodies moving through the medium according to specific proportionalities and fluid properties:\n\n1. **Resistance Proportional to Velocity or Velocity Squared**:  \n   - In some cases, resistance is \"in the ratio of the velocity,\" meaning the force of resistance is proportional to the velocity of the body. He proves in Proposition I (Book II, Section I) that if a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, the motion lost by resistance is proportional to the space traversed.  \n   - In other cases, particularly in \"mediums void of all tenacity,\" resistance is \"in the duplicate ratio of the velocity,\" i.e., proportional to the square of the velocity. This applies especially to elastic fluids like air.  \n   - He also describes resistances composed partly as the velocity and partly as the square of the velocity, combining both effects.\n\n2. **Dependence on Body Size and Medium Density**:  \n   - Resistance to a moving body is nearly proportional \"to the squares of the diameters and the densities of the parts conjunctly.\" For similar and equally swift bodies in an elastic fluid, resistance also scales with their diameter squared.  \n   - The resistance encountered by a globe or cylinder moving in a medium is proportional to the density of that medium compared to the density of the body, affecting how the body imparts motion to the fluid particles around it.\n\n3. **Fluid Behavior and Propagation of Pressure**:  \n   - Resistance arises from the \"excess of pressure of the fluid at the fore parts of the projectile above the pressure at the hinder parts,\" which excites motion in the fluid and consequently resists the body\u2019s motion.  \n   - Newton argues that this pressure is not propagated in straight lines through the fluid unless the fluid particles lie in a line, and that compression-generated pressure, if propagated instantaneously as in a continued, nonelastic fluid, does not itself augment or lessen resistance.\n\n4. **Effect of Fluid\u2019s Nature**:  \n   - In \"continued infinite mediums,\" the resistance to bodies like cylinders moving uniformly forward is proportional to the density of the medium and dimensions of the body.  \n   - The resistance cannot be lessened by the subtilty or fineness of the fluid\u2019s parts if density remains constant.\n\n5. **Excitation of Fluid Motion and its Resistance**:  \n   - As a body passes through fluid, it excites a motion in the fluid proportional to the pressure difference caused by the body\u2019s motion; resistance is likewise proportional to this excitation and the fluid's density.\n\n6. **Mathematical Treatment and Hypotheses**:  \n   - Newton treats the resistance proportional to velocity as a \"mathematical hypothesis more than a physical one,\" indicating the limitations or assumptions in his approach.  \n   - He uses geometrical and analytical reasoning, relating velocity segments, forces of gravity, and resistance forces (sometimes of mixed proportionality) to describe the retardation of motion and the shape of velocity curves over time.\n\n7. **Summary of Methodology**:  \n   - By defining resistive forces proportionally (either linear or quadratic in velocity), and applying compositions of forces and motions over space and time, Newton derives how bodies decelerate in resisting media.  \n   - He applies observations and experiments (e.g., pendulums) to confirm the proportionalities and explores the influence of fluid density, body size, and fluid elasticity on resistance.  \n   - The analytical method involves relating decrements of velocity to areas and segments in geometrical figures, matching physical resistance to mathematical descriptions of motion decay.\n\nIn conclusion, Newton handles motion in resisting media by modeling resistance forces as proportional either to velocity or to velocity squared, dependent on fluid properties, body size, and density; he treats resistance arising from pressure differentials in the fluid excited by the moving body, uses geometric and analytical methods to relate force, velocity, and motion loss, and confirms these laws by experiments such as with pendulums.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that:\n\n- **Absolute Time** \"flows equably without regard to anything external,\" being \"of itself, and from its own nature,\" called also duration. In contrast, relative time is \"some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion,\" such as hours or days.\n\n- **Absolute Space** \"in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.\" Relative space, however, is \"some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces,\" which our senses determine by position relative to bodies and is commonly mistaken for immovable space.\n\n- **Absolute Motion** is \"the translation of a body from one absolute place into another,\" while relative motion is \"the translation from one relative place into another.\" Relative places are movable and determined by reference to moving bodies (e.g., parts of a ship), whereas absolute places are fixed in immovable absolute space.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a fixed, immovable frame (absolute space) and true, equable time to define true rest and true motion. Real, absolute rest is \"the continuance of the body in the same part of that immovable space,\" unlike relative rest which is only rest relative to a moving system.\n\nThe causes that distinguish absolute from relative motion are the \"forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion,\" evidenced for example by the presence of centrifugal forces in \"true and absolute circular motion,\" forces absent in purely relative circular motion.\n\nBecause absolute rest cannot be determined by relative positions of bodies alone (as it depends on immovable space retained \"from infinity to infinity\"), Newton\u2019s framework grounds his laws in motions and forces referred to absolute space and absolute time rather than relative measures that depend on movable reference frames.\n\nThus, Newton\u2019s laws rely on the existence of absolute space and time as fixed, immutable backgrounds against which true motion and force can be defined and distinguished from mere relative changes of position.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. Beyond Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be with certainty traced.", "Beyond Isaac Newton's grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty. Two family traditions existed: one that the family was of Scotch extraction, and the other that they originally came from Newton in Lancashire, dwelling for a time at Westby in Lincolnshire before purchasing Woolsthorpe about a hundred years before Isaac Newton's birth. There is no certain record of any other descendants of Isaac Newton himself. His mother had children by a second marriage, producing four nieces of the half blood (grandchildren of his mother), but these are not descendants of Isaac Newton. The estates and family possessions passed through relatives such as John Newton (his uncle's great-grandson) and the family of the Earl of Portsmouth via the Viscountess Lymington. Isaac Newton himself never married and left no known legitimate offspring. Therefore, aside from his grandfather, no other descent of Isaac Newton is definitively known or recorded in the text."]}

Therefore, no claim amount will be paid.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The claim is denied due to the **36-month waiting period for knee replacement surgery**, which has not been completed (only 18 months coverage).\n- The **pre-existing disease waiting period of 48 months** further supports this denial.\n- If the waiting period had been fulfilled, the **5% co-payment clause** and the **\u20b95,000 per day room rent cap** would determine the admissible claim amount, reducing payable room rent and applying co-payment accordingly.\n- The relevant determining clauses for eligibility are:\n  - Waiting period for knee replacement surgery (36 months unless caused by Accident).\n  - Waiting period for pre-existing diseases (48 months).\n  - 5% co-payment clause.\n  - Room rent cap of \u20b95,000 per day.\n\nHence, no portion of the claim is admissible at this stage due to the unfulfilled waiting period requirements.", "The deductions applicable for a cataract surgery costing \u20b960,000 done in a non-network hospital, along with a private room stay costing \u20b97,500 per day for three days, under a policy with a sum insured of \u20b92,00,000, are as follows based on sub-limits, room rent conditions, and reimbursement rules:\n\n1. **Hospital Type (Non-Network Hospital):**  \n   Since the surgery is done in a non-network hospital, any special negotiated rates or full cashless benefits available at network hospitals do not apply. Reimbursement will be subject to the policy terms regarding non-network hospitals.\n\n2. **Room Rent Condition and Proportionate Deduction:**  \n   The patient stayed in a private room costing \u20b97,500 per day for three days, totaling \u20b922,500.  \n   If the policy imposes a room rent sub-limit or limits reimbursement to a certain room rent category (often less than private room rent), the excess amount spent over the allowed limit will be deducted proportionately from the claim amount.  \n   For example, if the policy only covers room rent up to \u20b95,000/day, then:  \n   - Excess per day = \u20b97,500 - \u20b95,000 = \u20b92,500  \n   - Total excess for 3 days = \u20b92,500 \u00d7 3 = \u20b97,500  \n   This excess \u20b97,500 is deducted proportionately from the total claim amount.\n\n3. **Sub-Limits and Sum Insured:**  \n   The surgery cost of \u20b960,000 will be restricted by any specific sub-limit for cataract surgery if present (not specified in the text). However, the total claim including surgery and hospital stay cannot exceed the overall sum insured of \u20b92,00,000. Since \u20b960,000 + \u20b922,500 = \u20b982,500, which is below the sum insured, no deduction arises from the sum insured limit itself.\n\n4. **Reimbursement Rules:**  \n   In the case of hospitalization in a non-network hospital, the claimant will have to pay upfront and seek reimbursement later. Reimbursement is made after deducting the proportionate excess due to room rent above sub-limit and any other applicable sub-limits on surgery cost or hospital charges. The policy may also take into account other terms like co-payment or fixed deduction clauses if mentioned (not specified here).\n\nIn summary:\n- The non-network hospital status means no cashless benefit; reimbursement is subject to policy terms.  \n- The room rent excess over the allowed sub-limit (if any) will cause a proportionate deduction from the claim amount. If allowed room rent per day is less than \u20b97,500, then excess is deducted accordingly.  \n- The surgery cost and room rent total are within the sum insured of \u20b92,00,000, so no sum insured limit deduction applies.  \n- Reimbursement will be made after applying these deductions based on the policy\u2019s defined sub-limits and room rent conditions.\n\nThe precise deduction amount depends on the policy\u2019s specified room rent limits and surgery sub-limits, which are not detailed here. However, the key point is that any excess room rent beyond the allowed limit leads to a proportionate deduction, and being a non-network hospital implies reimbursement after claim settlement with these deductions.", "The payable claim amount for the 77-year-old insured hospitalized in the ICU at \u20b912,000 per day over 5 days, with a total claim of \u20b91,20,000, is determined by applying the following policy provisions:\n\n1. **Co-payment of 15% for persons above 75 years:** Since the insured is 77 years old, a 15% co-payment applies on the admissible claim amount.\n\n2. **ICU room rent cap of \u20b910,000 per day:** Although the hospital charge is \u20b912,000 per day, the policy limits reimbursement for ICU to a maximum of \u20b910,000 per day.\n\n3. **Full waiver of initial waiting periods for accidents:** Since the hospitalization is due to an accidental fall, the usual waiting periods do not apply, so the entire claim related to the accident is eligible for consideration.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Total eligible ICU charges = \u20b910,000 per day \u00d7 5 days = \u20b950,000  \n- Deduct 15% co-payment = 15% of \u20b950,000 = \u20b97,500  \n- Payable amount = \u20b950,000 \u2013 \u20b97,500 = \u20b942,500\n\n**Parts of the policy guiding this decision:**\n\n- The **co-payment clause of 15% for persons above 75 years** mandates that the insured bears 15% of the admissible claim amount.  \n- The **cap of \u20b910,000/day on ICU room rent** restricts daily claimable charges for ICU hospitalization to \u20b910,000 despite higher actual charges.  \n- The **full waiver of initial waiting periods for accidents** ensures the claim is admissible immediately without waiting period restrictions because the cause is an accident.\n\nHence, the insurance company will pay \u20b942,500 after applying the ICU daily cap and the co-payment deduction. The accident-related hospitalization coverage is fully considered due to the waiver of waiting periods.", "The break in coverage of three months after being covered for two years affects the portability benefits and continuity of the policy as follows:\n\n1. **Portability Benefits and Continuity:** Continuity of coverage, which allows the insured to avail portability benefits such as reduction or waiver of waiting periods, is contingent upon an unbroken coverage period. A discontinuity (break) in the policy coverage\u2014for example, a three-month gap after two years of coverage\u2014interrupts this continuity, thereby affecting portability.\n\n2. **Effect on Waiting Periods:** The original policy had a 36-month waiting period for certain surgeries and a 48-month waiting period for pre-existing diseases. Because of the three-month discontinuity, these waiting periods effectively restart or are reset from the date of reinstatement or new policy commencement. The break negates the prior waiting periods elapsed under the original policy. Therefore, the individual would likely be subject again to the full waiting periods (36 months for surgeries and 48 months for pre-existing diseases) under the new insurer\u2019s policy.\n\n3. **Policy Conditions on Portability:** The portability clause requires continuous coverage to maintain the benefits of reduced or waived waiting periods. A break of three months fails to meet this continuity condition, thus portability benefits cannot be claimed.\n\nIn summary, a three-month break in coverage following two years of insurance results in loss of continuity, causing waiting periods for surgeries (36 months) and pre-existing diseases (48 months) to reset under the new insurer\u2019s policy, thereby negating portability benefits as per the policy\u2019s conditions and portability clauses.", "The claim for robotic surgery costing \u20b93,00,000 followed by post-hospitalization care of \u20b930,000 under a policy with a \u20b95,00,000 sum insured will be impacted as follows:\n\n1. **Modern Treatment Sub-limit:**  \n   There is a defined sub-limit applicable to the robotic component of treatments. Robotic surgeries have a specific limitation on claim amounts within the overall sum insured. The claim amount eligible for the robotic surgery portion may be capped or restricted by this modern treatment sub-limit, which means that even though the surgery cost is \u20b93,00,000, the reimbursable amount could be less if the sub-limit is lower than the actual cost. This sub-limit does not allow full coverage automatically for the robotic component irrespective of the sum insured.\n\n2. **Post-Hospitalization Care Coverage and Rules:**  \n   Post-hospitalization expenses incurred for 50 days amounting to \u20b930,000 are subject to policy terms regarding post-hospitalization care coverage. There is a specified timeframe for the claim of such expenses post-discharge, and typically only expenses incurred within the defined post-hospitalization period are admissible. The policy may require documentation proving these medical expenses were incurred as part of the care related to the hospitalization for robotic surgery.\n\n3. **Documentation Requirements and Claim Submission Timelines:**  \n   Claimants must provide detailed documentation substantiating both the robotic surgery and the post-hospitalization care expenses, including medical reports, bills, and receipts. The submission must observe the policy-required timelines for claim filing to avoid rejection. Delays beyond stipulated timelines or lack of adequate documentation may result in partial or full denial of the claim.\n\n4. **Robotic Component Limitations:**  \n   The policy explicitly restricts robotic surgical treatment claims to a pre-defined limit within the sum insured. This limit acts as a cap specifically on the robotic technology portion of the treatment cost, separate from other hospitalization charges. Hence, while the sum insured is \u20b95,00,000, the claim for robotic surgery may be restricted below \u20b93,00,000, depending on that sub-limit.\n\n5. **Claim Amount Impact Summary:**  \n   - The total sum insured (\u20b95,00,000) governs the overall liability, but the robotic surgery part is subject to a separate, lower modern treatment sub-limit.  \n   - Post-hospitalization expenses up to \u20b930,000 can be claimed only if within allowed post-hospitalization period and properly documented.  \n   - Both components must comply with timely submission and documentation requirements.  \n   - Failure to meet the sub-limit rules or post-hospitalization claim conditions leads to reduced claim payout.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim for \u20b93,00,000 robotic surgery plus \u20b930,000 post-hospitalization care will be limited firstly by the robotic treatment sub-limit within the \u20b95,00,000 sum insured, secondly by adherence to post-hospitalization claim rules (time duration and documentation), and lastly by strict compliance with documentation and claim submission timelines to ensure eligibility and avoid claim rejection."]}

Pre- and post-natal expenses up to Rs 5,000 are covered within the maternity limit on an inpatient basis.\n\nThe newborn baby is covered from Day 1 within the family Sum Insured, provided the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted. Acceptance of the newborn as an insured person requires written notification on or before the last day of the month following the birth of the child and receipt of the agreed premium.\n\nIf the newborn expires within 24 hours and requires separate intensive care, the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses depends on the following conditions:\n\n- The treatment expenses for the newborn must be medically necessary and incurred on the written medical advice of a medical practitioner.\n\n- All benefits are payable only if the insurer has authorized the cover before treatment starts.\n\n- The newborn\u2019s treatment is subject to the same policy covering terms applicable to all insured persons, including any applicable deductibles, co-pays, and limits.\n\n- Exclusions applicable to newborn care include treatments for congenital anomalies or defects (not covered), treatments not requiring hospitalization, and treatments that are not medically necessary or reasonable charges. Alternative treatments and certain specified exclusions do not apply.\n\n- Documents required include medical history, hospital bills, discharge summary, prescriptions, and in case of death claims, death summary and death certificate.\n\n- Ambulance charges are limited to Rs. 2,000 per person; room rent for ICU is charged at 4% of the Sum Insured.\n\n- The policy excludes domiciliary hospitalization, so treatment must be inpatient.\n\nTherefore, while maternity and newborn coverage include treatment expenses for the newborn from birth, coverage is subject to prior authorization, notification, premium payment, and adherence to policy terms including limits and exclusions. The newborn\u2019s treatment expenses for intensive care after birth and before expiry can be claimed if all these conditions are met and the expenses are supported by proper medical documentation. However, any treatment for congenital anomalies or treatments not medically necessary or excluded under the policy will not be reimbursed.", "A claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment supported only by a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient to meet the policy requirements.\n\nJustification:\n\n1. **Eligible Mental Health Practitioners:**  \n   - A \"Mental Healthcare Professional\" includes (i) a psychiatrist, (ii) a professional registered with the concerned State Authority, (iii) a professional with specified post-graduate degrees in Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha related to psychiatry, or (iv) a Clinical Psychologist holding recognized qualifications approved by the Rehabilitation Council of India or equivalent (e.g., recognized postgraduate degrees and supervised clinical training).  \n   - A \"Psychiatrist\" must be a medical practitioner with a recognized postgraduate degree or diploma in psychiatry from a university recognized by the Medical Council of India or equivalent.\n\n2. **Role of Attending Medical Practitioner:**  \n   - Claims must be supported by attending medical practitioner's certificates regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, including dates of diagnosis, investigation reports, all supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.  \n   - A \"Medical Practitioner\" is defined as a person holding valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or Medical Council of India or equivalent, authorized to practice medicine within the jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Claim Document Requirements:**  \n   - The claim must be supported with original documents: duly completed claim form, photo ID and age proof, health card, policy copy, attending medical practitioner's certificate for diagnosis/treatment with prescription, detailed hospital discharge summary (usually from the hospital, supported by original hospital bills and payment receipts), and relevant investigation reports and medicines bills with prescriptions.  \n   - The discharge certificate/summary must be from the hospital or treating medical practitioner. A discharge summary solely certified by a Clinical Psychologist (who is a mental health professional but not a medical practitioner) does not fulfill the requirement of attending medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis and treatment rendered.\n\n4. **Prescription from General Practitioner Limitation:**  \n   - While a prescription from the attending medical practitioner is required, a general practitioner's prescription alone is insufficient for psychiatric inpatient treatment claims where specialist consultation is expected, especially for mental illnesses covered under the policy such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis.  \n   - The treating medical practitioner\u2019s certificate must reflect the diagnosis, treatment, and medical necessity. A prescription from only a general practitioner and not a psychiatrist or eligible mental healthcare professional invalidates the claim documentation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nA discharge summary certified solely by a registered Clinical Psychologist along with a general practitioner\u2019s prescription does not satisfy the policy requirements because:  \n\n- The discharge summary must come from the hospital or attending medical practitioner (a qualified medical doctor), not only a Clinical Psychologist.  \n- The diagnosis and treatment certificate must be from a medical practitioner registered and authorized to practice medicine, ideally a psychiatrist or at least the attending doctor overseeing treatment.  \n- The prescription alone cannot substitute for a medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTherefore, for a valid inpatient psychiatric claim, supporting documents must include a hospital discharge summary signed by the attending medical practitioner (psychiatrist or authorized doctor) and prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner, not just a general practitioner and Clinical Psychologist certification.", "ECG electrodes and gloves used during oral chemotherapy sessions have specific admissibility and constraints:\n\n- **ECG Electrodes:** Payable up to 5 electrodes are allowed for every case visiting Operating Theatre (OT) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU). For longer ICU stays, a change of electrodes is permitted, with at least one set payable every second day.\n\n- **Gloves:** Only sterilized gloves are payable. Unsterilized gloves are not payable.\n\nThere is no explicit mention restricting these items only to chemotherapy sessions; however, the coverage for oral chemotherapy itself is subject to limits specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance. The consumables are admissible as long as they relate directly to the treatment and comply with the stated constraints on quantity and sterilization.\n\nTherefore, for a patient receiving oral chemotherapy in a network hospital:\n- ECG electrodes can be reimbursed under the limits described (up to 5 per session or as per ICU stay norms).\n- Only sterilized gloves used during the session are admissible for reimbursement.\n\nNo additional constraints specifically related to chemotherapy sessions are detailed for these items, other than the general rules on medical necessity and hospitalization/day care treatment applicability.", "Pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation medical expenses can be claimed subject to specific conditions and limits defined in the policy:\n\n1. **Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:**\n   - Covered on a reimbursement basis for expenses incurred during the pre-defined number of days preceding the hospitalisation.\n   - These expenses must be related to the **same Illness or Injury** for which inpatient hospitalisation was required.\n   - The pre-hospitalisation expenses must have been incurred within the number of days specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance (the exact number of days is not provided in the text).\n   - The inpatient hospitalisation claim must be accepted for the corresponding illness.\n   - In this case, an expense incurred 18 days before admission is claimable **only if** it falls within the specified pre-hospitalisation period in the Policy Schedule and relates to the same illness that required hospitalisation.\n\n2. **Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:**\n   - Covered on a reimbursement basis for expenses incurred up to the number of days and amount limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.\n   - These expenses must be:\n     - Incurred **immediately following discharge** from hospital related to the illness for which hospitalisation claim was accepted.\n     - For the **same Condition/Illness** for which the insured was hospitalised.\n     - The inpatient hospitalisation claim must be admissible.\n   - The insurance considers the date of discharge as the last discharge date from hospital for that illness.\n   - Post-hospitalisation expenses must be incurred within the pre-defined number of days **immediately after discharge**, as per the policy's specified limit.\n   - Pharmacy expenses and diagnostics related directly to the illness and hospitalisation are payable if incurred within this post-hospitalisation period.\n   - In this scenario, an infection develops 20 days after discharge. Whether the 20-day post-discharge diagnostic and pharmacy expenses can be claimed depends on whether 20 days falls within the post-hospitalisation period allowed by the policy schedule. The text does not specify that period numerically, so this must be checked in the Policy Schedule. If 20 days exceed the allowed post-hospitalisation claim period, these expenses would not be reimbursable.\n\n3. **General Conditions and Limits:**\n   - Both pre- and post-hospitalisation claims are payable only if an inpatient hospitalisation claim for the same illness is accepted under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2.\n   - The expenses must be directly related and incidental to the same illness for which the hospitalisation claim was accepted.\n   - All claims are limited to the pre-defined number of days and the amount limits as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, whichever is less.\n   - Claims must be submitted with supporting documents and within the prescribed time limits.\n   \n**Summary:**\n- Pre-hospitalisation expenses 18 days before admission can be claimed if they fall within the pre-hospitalisation period defined by the policy and relate to the same illness.\n- Post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge can be claimed **only if** the policy\u2019s specified post-hospitalisation period covers up to or beyond 20 days; otherwise, these expenses are not payable.\n\nIf the number of allowable days for pre- or post-hospitalisation expenses in the Policy Schedule is not given or exceeded, the corresponding expenses cannot be claimed.", "Coverage for a dependent child who turns 27 during the policy period continues until the end of that policy period, provided the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year. Upon the dependent ceasing to be a dependent (such as by reaching the age limit of 26 years), coverage ends \"unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period.\"\n\nThe policy stipulates that cover will end for a dependent \"when a dependent insured person ceases to be a Dependent,\" but may continue to the expiry of the policy period if specifically agreed. The deletion of such a dependent from the policy is to be done by the Policyholder notifying the insurer, with deletions effective typically from the end of the policy period if the dependent ages out during that period.\n\nThus, eligibility terminates when the dependent turns 27, removing their status as a dependent. However, because the premium was paid covering the full policy year in advance, the coverage continues until the end of the policy period. The dependent will be deleted from the policy effective at the policy expiry or as per the Policyholder\u2019s notification, with no coverage beyond that point.\n\nIn summary:\n- Coverage continues until the end of the policy period in which the dependent turns 27.\n- Coverage terminates at policy expiry or upon deletion following the dependent reaching 27.\n- Deletion notification must be made by the Policyholder on or before the last day of the succeeding month after the change.\n- No coverage or premium refund is applicable beyond this termination point unless specifically agreed otherwise.", "When an insured opts for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit under the policy, the reimbursement of associated medical expenses\u2014including diagnostic and specialist fees billed separately\u2014is carried out on a proportionate basis as per the \"Proportionate Clause.\" This clause states:\n\n- The reimbursement/payment for all associated medical expenses incurred at the hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible room rent rate per day bears to the actual room rent rate per day paid by the insured.  \n- Proportionate deductions are applied only when differential billing based on room category is followed by the hospital. If differential billing is not followed or not adopted for certain expenses, proportionate deductions will not apply to those expenses.\n\nThe relevant clause is found in the section detailing inpatient hospitalisation coverage and reads thus:\n\n\"We will pay the Reasonable and Customary Charges for medical expenses including room, boarding, nursing, operation theatre costs, diagnostics, specialist fees, and other treatment-related expenses. Note 1: Proportionate Clause: In case of admission to a room at rates exceeding the limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance, the reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses incurred at the Hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.\"\n\nHence, the insured will not receive full reimbursement for the excess room rent or related medical expenses but will have these expenses reimbursed proportionately according to the room rent limits stipulated in the policy schedule. Diagnostic and specialist fees charged separately will be subject to the same proportional deduction if billed differentially based on the room category.", "If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insurer/TPA will notify the insured of the deficiency in the claim documents. The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to submit the missing or additional documents. During this period, up to three reminders may be sent. If the deficiency is not met or is only partially met within these 10 working days, the insurer may, at its sole discretion, deduct the claim amount related to the deficient documents and settle the balance of the claim if otherwise valid under the policy.\n\nIf the insured resubmits the required documents after these 10 days, the rules on timeliness suggest this may be considered beyond the prescribed period; however, in extreme hardship cases, a waiver of submission deadlines may be considered if proven satisfactory to the company.\n\nIn case the final rejection of the claim is communicated, the company will provide a written explanation of the grounds for rejection within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report. The insured person then has 15 days from the date of receipt of the rejection decision to represent to the insurer for reconsideration of the decision.\n\nThe grievance and appeal procedures allow the insured to contest the final rejection by submitting a representation within the 15-day window after receiving the rejection notification. All communications related to the claim dispute or contestation must be made in writing, sent to the insurer at the address or electronic contact specified in the policy schedule.\n\nIn summary, the course of action is:\n\n1. Upon partial rejection due to missing documentation, respond by submitting the required documents within 10 working days of intimation.\n\n2. If resubmitted after 10 days, consideration depends on company discretion and potential waiver for hardship.\n\n3. If final rejection is received, the insured may appeal by representing to the insurer within 15 days of the decision.\n\n4. All communications must be in writing, addressed as per policy instructions.\n\n5. Disputes or differences are subject to Indian law and courts.\n\nThis procedural sequence ensures compliance with claim timelines and provides a clear grievance mechanism for contesting final claim rejections.", "The insured person's claim for hospitalization of 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia is eligible under the category of **Day Care Treatment**. \n\n**Relevant Category and Requirements:**\n\n- **Day Care Treatment** is defined as medical treatment and/or surgical procedure:\n  i. \"undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement,\" and\n  ii. \"which would have otherwise required a hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.\"\n\n- Hospitalization means admission for a minimum of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours except for specified procedures/treatments where admission could be for less than 24 hours.\n\nGiven that the surgery typically required more than 24 hours hospitalization but now, due to technological advances, is completed in less than 24 hours (here, 22 hours), and it was done under general anesthesia, the procedure fits the definition of Day Care Treatment.\n\nTherefore, the claim is eligible under **Day Care Treatment**, as it meets both criteria of being under general anesthesia and having a duration of less than 24 hours due to technological advances but originally requiring more than 24 hours of hospitalization.", "For a hospital in a town with a population less than 1,000,000 to qualify under this policy, the following minimum infrastructure requirements must be met:\n\n1.

If the Insured Person is continuously covered without any break, as defined under the portability norms of the extant IRDAI regulations, the waiting period for the same disease or procedure will be reduced to the extent of prior coverage.\n\n3. This means the time already spent under the earlier continuous health insurance coverage is credited and subtracted from the waiting period, effectively reducing the waiting period on porting.\n\n4. The exclusion does not apply to claims arising from an accident.\n\n5. Continuity benefits (such as waiver or reduction of waiting periods) apply if the policy is ported without any lapses, aligned with IRDAI guidelines on portability.\n\nTherefore, specifically for knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis, if previously covered continuously under another insurer and the policyholder ports the policy without a break, the waiting period under this policy will be decreased by the duration of prior coverage, providing continuity benefits in waiting periods according to IRDAI portability norms.", "If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, coverage of the expense depends on the criteria of \"medical necessity\" and the classification of the treatment.\n\n\"Medical Necessity\" is defined as any treatment, tests, medication, or hospital stay which:  \ni. is required for the medical management of the illness or injury suffered by the insured;  \nii. does not exceed the level of care necessary to provide safe, adequate, and appropriate medical care in scope, duration, or intensity;  \niii. has been prescribed by a medical practitioner; and  \niv. conforms to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India.\n\nRegarding \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment,\" it is defined as treatment, including drug experimental therapy, which is not based on established medical practice in India and lacks significant medical documentation to support its effectiveness.\n\nExpenses related to any unproven treatment, services, or supplies in connection with treatment are excluded under Code-Excl16.\n\nTherefore:  \n- If the imported medication is prescribed by a registered Medical Practitioner as medically necessary per the above definition and is not considered unproven or experimental, the expense may be covered.  \n- If the medication falls under unproven/experimental treatment (i.e., lacking established medical practice in India or adequate documentation of effectiveness), expenses related to it are excluded.  \n\nIn summary, an imported medication not normally used in India will only be covered if it is certified as medically necessary by the attending Medical Practitioner and does not classify as an unproven or experimental treatment as defined.

After policy expiry, renewal is possible within a Grace Period of 30 days to maintain continuity of benefits without a break, although coverage is generally not available during the grace period except when premium is paid in installments.\n\nNo fresh underwriting is required at renewal unless there is an increase in the sum insured. If increased sum insured is requested, underwriting applies only to the increased amount. Upon renewal, no loading will be applied based on individual claims experience. Additionally, in case of policy withdrawal, insured persons (including dependents) have the option to migrate to a similar health insurance product offered by the company at renewal, gaining accrued continuity benefits such as cumulative bonus and waiver of waiting periods if the policy is maintained without break.\n\nTherefore, upon a member\u2019s death, dependents may continue coverage up to policy expiry at the insured\u2019s option, and options for continued coverage beyond expiry include renewal within the grace period or migration to similar products with continuity benefits.", "For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the policy requires submission of the original invoice along with the implant stickers for all implants used during surgery (for example, stent invoice and sticker in angioplasty surgery).

The policy specifies that an original invoice with the implant sticker is mandatory, implying that a generic invoice lacking the implant sticker would not fulfill the documentation requirement. This deficiency may lead to rejection or deduction of the claim amount unless the insured satisfies the company regarding the circumstances.\n\nThus, for implanted device claims, the implant-specific invoice with the implant sticker is essential; failing to provide it may adversely affect claim admissibility and settlement.", "Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement only if these services are medically necessary, arranged immediately after hospital treatment, and recommended by the specialist who treated the patient. Specifically, home nursing must be provided by a Qualified Nurse visiting the patient's home to deliver expert nursing services required due to the insured's medical condition following hospital discharge.\n\nThe reimbursement is contingent upon the inpatient hospitalisation claim being admissible, meaning the insured must have been hospitalised for at least 24 consecutive hours for a covered event. The home nursing services must be related and incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment; expenses unrelated or not incidental are excluded.\n\nDocumentation required to support home nursing claims includes:\n\n- Duly completed claim form.\n\n- Photo ID and age proof.\n\n- Health Card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n\n- Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon\u2019s certificate specifying diagnosis, nature of operation performed, and date of diagnosis, supported by investigation test reports and prescription.\n\n- Medical history records including previous consultation papers showing history and treatment of the current ailment.\n\n- Original final hospital bill with detailed break-up of charges and payment receipts.\n\n- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n\n- Original invoice and receipt of nursing charges.\n\n- Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheets detailing medical history, treatment details, and patient progress.\n\n- Medical practitioner's prescription recommending home nursing.\n\nIn accidental cases, a Motor Lorry Case (MLC)/First Information Report (FIR) copy may be required.\n\nHome nursing charges that are for personal custodial care (such as assistance with activities of daily living) without medical necessity or are part of non-medical expenses are excluded from reimbursement.\n\nClaims must be submitted within the prescribed time limits (e.g., within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment), and original documents should bear the insured person's name.\n\nIn summary, home nursing after a serious accident and hospitalisation is reimbursable only if medically necessary, prescribed by the treating specialist, and related to the covered hospitalisation event, with complete supporting original documentation as enumerated above. Expenses for custodial care not medically required or unrelated to the diagnosis and treatment are excluded.", "In a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the procedure is as follows:\n\n1. The Insured Person files the claim under one chosen policy, whose insurer becomes the primary Insurer.\n\n2. If the coverage under this primary policy is insufficient to cover the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will obtain details of the other available policies held by the Policyholder.\n\n3. The primary Insurer will then coordinate with the other Insurers to ensure settlement of the remaining balance amount as per the terms and conditions of those policies.\n\n4. This coordination and settlement of the balance amount by other Insurers will occur provided the Insured Person has submitted a written request for such coordination.\n\nRegarding documentation, the following is required for claim submission, which may be accepted in certified form if originals were submitted to other insurers:\n\n- Medical diagnosis/nature of operation details with date, supported by prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner.\n\n- Complete medical history, including all previous consultation papers, treatment details, bills with detailed breakups, and payment receipts, duly supported by prescriptions.\n\n- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n\n- Photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n\n- Original final hospital bills with detailed break-up including deposit and final payment receipts.\n\n- Original invoices and payment receipts for implants used during surgeries with corresponding stickers (e.g., lens sticker in cataract surgery).\n\n- All original diagnostic reports (imaging, laboratory) with prescriptions and invoices.\n\n- Original medicine/pharmacy bills with prescriptions.\n\n- MLC/FIR copy in accidental cases.\n\n- Copy of death summary and death certificate in death claims.\n\n- Pre and post-operative imaging reports.\n\n- Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheets detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.\n\n- Cheque copy with proposer\u2019s name or bank passbook/statement not older than 3 months.\n\nIn case the claim is lodged under a Settlement under multiple policies clause and the original documents have already been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified copies of these documents and claim settlement advice from the other insurer, subject to satisfaction.\n\nThis coordination process is to be performed by the primary insurer only after receipt of a written request from the Insured Person.\n\nAll communications related to the Policy and claims must be made in writing to the company\u2019s specified address or electronic contacts.\n\nThe claim administration involves submission of documents, assessment of claim admissibility, medical examinations if required, and compliance with insurer\u2019s verification processes.\n\nPayment of claim to the Policyholder/Insured Person or legal representative will be considered a complete discharge of the Company\u2019s liability for the particular claim amount paid.", "Expenses incurred for hospitalization primarily for evaluation and diagnostic purposes only, where all tests and imaging are negative and result in a decision of no treatment, are excluded from claim. This follows from the exclusion clause \"Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)\" which states: \n\ni. \"Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded;\"\n\nii. \"Any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.\"\n\nSince no treatment was undertaken, these expenses are not considered medically necessary treatment. Also, under the exclusions, conditions that \"could have been done on an out-patient basis without any Hospitalisation\" are excluded from coverage.\n\nTherefore, hospitalization expenses incurred solely for evaluation and diagnostic purposes without any subsequent treatment are not claimable under the policy.", "The insurer requires that any change of nomination be communicated to the Company in writing and such change shall be effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the death of the policyholder, the Company will pay the nominee as named in the Policy Schedule, Policy Certificate, or any existing Endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee endorsed on the policy, the Company will pay the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder, and their discharge shall be treated as full and final discharge of the liability under the policy.\n\nTherefore, if the previous nominee has a sudden demise and there is no prior endorsement for a nominee change, the insured or policyholder must submit a written request for nomination change, which will become effective only after the Company makes an endorsement on the policy. Until such endorsement is made, the existing nomination stands. If there is no subsisting nominee endorsed, claims will be paid to the legal heirs or legal representatives.\n\nEndorsement requests, including nominee changes, must be made in writing by the policyholder and are subject to assessment by the underwriter, who may request additional information or documents before processing the change.", "Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization, in the following scenarios based on the definitions and exclusions:\n\n1. Prostheses, corrective devices, and medical appliances which are not required intra-operatively for the Illness or Injury for which the Insured Person was hospitalized.  \n2. Any prostheses or medical appliances related to treatments not medically necessary or not supported by clinical protocols for the insured condition.  \n3. Cosmetic or plastic surgery prostheses or appliances, or those used for change-of-gender treatments, unless for reconstruction following an Accident, Burn(s), Cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment removing an immediate health risk certified by a Medical Practitioner.  \n4. Devices such as those used in the treatment of Sleep Apnea Syndrome (C.P.A.P.), oxygen concentrators for bronchial asthmatic conditions, infusion pumps, or other external devices used during or after treatment.  \n5. Prostheses or medical appliances related to treatment not requiring hospitalization (treatable on an outpatient basis).  \n6. Items that fall under routine or non-treatment categories, such as hearing aids, spectacles, contact lenses, or routine eye examinations.  \n7. Any prostheses or medical appliances used in alternate medicine or treatments not supported by prescription or clinical protocols.  \n8. Prostheses or medical appliances used in certifications, diagnoses, or treatment provided by family members, non-registered persons, or medical practitioners practicing outside their licensed discipline.  \n9. Medical appliances or prostheses related to cosmetic treatments, alopecia, baldness, wigs, or hair fall treatments and products.  \n10. Medical appliances or prostheses associated with hospitalization without undertaking eligible treatment normally requiring a hospital stay.  \n11. Prostheses or appliances related to treatment outside India.  \n\nThese exclusions reference the definitions of prostheses and medical appliances and the concept that coverage is only for devices \"required intra-operatively\" or medically necessary for the illness or injury causing the hospitalization. Devices or treatments that are not medically necessary, not prescribed, or used in excluded conditions are not covered even during hospitalization.", "Expenses for inpatient care for mental illness at an AYUSH hospital that is not locally registered will not be reimbursed. This is because hospitalization benefits require admission in a hospital that is \"registered as a hospital with the local authorities under Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010 or ... complies with all minimum criteria\" which includes having qualified practitioners and specified infrastructure. \n\nSpecifically for AYUSH hospitals, an AYUSH Day Care Centre or hospital must be \"registered with the local authorities, wherever applicable,\" have \"qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioner(s) in charge,\" maintain daily records accessible to the insurer, have at least 5 inpatient beds, and have qualified AYUSH practitioners in charge round the clock.\n\nAdditionally, expenses incurred in any hospital or by any medical practitioner \"specifically excluded by the Insurer and disclosed on its website/notified to the policyholders are not admissible.\" A hospital not registered locally is essentially non-compliant with these registration requirements, leading to exclusion of reimbursement.\n\nThus, even if the AYUSH hospital has qualified practitioners, the lack of local registration renders inpatient treatment expenses non-reimbursable under this policy.", "If an insured requests a cashless facility at a network provider and subsequently changes their diagnosis, treatment plan, or incurs a higher cost estimate during hospitalization, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or the TPA. This must be done in accordance with the pre-authorization process previously described. The hospital/provider must complete and submit a revised cashless request form along with updated medical information to the TPA for verification and re-issuance of a pre-authorization letter. Until such fresh authorization is obtained, cashless eligibility is not maintained for the changed treatment plan or increased costs.  \n\nAdditionally, any non-admissible expenses, costs above specified sub-limits, co-payments, or deductibles must be settled directly by the insured with the hospital at the time of discharge. Failure to provide relevant medical details or obtain re-authorization may lead the TPA to deny pre-authorization, though denial of pre-authorization does not equate to denial of treatment or coverage.  \n\nIn summary, to maintain cashless eligibility after a treatment plan change resulting in a higher estimate, the hospital/provider must:  \n1. Notify and submit the revised treatment plan and cost estimate to the TPA via the cashless request form.  \n2. Obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer/TPA in line with the pre-authorization process.  \n3. Ensure that all details of authorized treatment match the actual treatment received once re-authorized.  \n4. Inform the insured to settle any non-admissible or excess expenses directly at discharge.", "If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, the pre-hospitalization claim shall be processed only after the decision on the main hospitalization claim has been made. Specifically, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will be assessed and settled on a reimbursement basis only after the inpatient hospitalization claim under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2 is accepted. The policy requires that:\n\n1. The inpatient hospitalization claim must be accepted first.\n2. The pre-hospitalization expenses must relate to the same illness or injury as the inpatient claim.\n3. The processing sequence mandates that \"The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim... shall be processed only after decision of the main Hospitalisation claim.\"\n4. The claim assessment follows a progressive order, including application of proportionate clause, co-pay, limit/sub-limit, and deductible, all applied to admissible claims after the main hospitalization claim is accepted.\n\nThus, pre-hospitalization claims submitted prior to approval of the main hospitalization claim are held pending that decision and only processed thereafter according to the policy's claim assessment sequence.", "The policyholder's contact details are not explicitly provided in the text.

Fraud is defined as acts with intent to deceive the insurer, such as suggesting as fact what is untrue, active concealment of facts known to be true, any other act fitted to deceive, or any act or omission declared fraudulent by law.\n\nFor claims with missing documents, the insurer scrutinizes the claim form and accompanying documents. If deficiencies in necessary documents are not fully rectified within 10 working days of the first intimation (with up to three reminders), the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount related to the deficient documentation and still settle the claim if otherwise valid under the policy. However, failure to submit required documents timely can lead to partial or full denial.\n\nRegarding forged documents, since forgery entails fraudulent means, such claims would be treated under the fraud clause\u2014resulting in policy benefits and premiums forfeiture and repayment of any amounts already paid under that claim.\n\nThus, the verdict for claims with missing documents may be partial deduction or settlement denial depending on timely compliance with document requests, while claims involving forged documents will be rejected under the fraud clause with forfeiture of benefits and premium, and repayment liability imposed on the claimants.", "Reimbursement is generally available only for Medical Expenses incurred on Medically Necessary Treatment of the Insured Person and related to Hospitalisation or specified related benefits.

This design ensures that network hardware or ISP-level compression algorithms do not interfere with the test, thereby providing a true measure of raw bandwidth."]}

The objective of this investment commitment was to improve the production capacity of semiconductor chips manufactured in Wisconsin and to expand related advanced manufacturing capabilities in the United States to strengthen the domestic technology infrastructure.", "The new policy imposes a 100 percent tariff on computer chips and semiconductors manufactured abroad. However, companies that manufacture within the United States are exempt from this tariff. The purpose of the policy is to stimulate domestic manufacturing and reduce dependency on foreign semiconductor supplies. This measure aims to support American technological self-sufficiency and innovation.\n\nRegarding the impact on consumers and the global market, the policy is likely to limit availability of certain foreign-made video chips and thereby increase domestic production. It may provoke retaliatory trade restrictions from other countries, potentially leading to increased costs. For example, companies like Apple and Google, mentioned as major players, might experience supply challenges or cost increases due to this tariff, which could affect product prices and market dynamics globally.\n\nIn summary, consumers might face higher prices or limited access to some products due to increased costs from tariffs and retaliation. Globally, the market could experience increased trade tensions and disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain as this policy drives shifts toward domestic production but also elicits countermeasures."]}
