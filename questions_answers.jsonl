There is no direct reference to theft, motor vehicle theft, or the corresponding legal case category in the given chunks.", "Arresting a person without a warrant can be legal under certain conditions but includes strict safeguards. Upon arrest, the person must be:\n\n1. Informed \"as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest\" and must not be denied \"the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" (Protection against arrest and detention, Article 22(1))\n\n2. Produced \"before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate.\" The person cannot be detained beyond this period without magistrate authority. (Article 22(2))\n\nExceptions include persons who are \"enemy aliens\" or those arrested under laws providing for preventive detention. Preventive detention laws themselves impose additional restrictions, such as maximum detention periods not exceeding three months unless an Advisory Board of judges reports sufficient cause for extension. (Article 22(3,4))\n\nTherefore, arrest without a warrant is permissible provided these procedural protections and time limits are strictly followed. Detention without informing the reasons or legal representation, or detention beyond 24 hours without magistrate approval, is not lawful according to the constitutional safeguards outlined.", "No, denying a job solely on the basis of caste is not allowed. Article 16(2) of the Constitution ensures that \"no citizen shall, on grounds only of ... caste ... be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.\" Furthermore, Article 17 abolishes \"Untouchability\" and forbids its practice in any form, declaring enforcement of any disability arising from untouchability an offence punishable by law. However, the State is permitted to make provisions for reservation of appointments or posts in favor of backward classes or economically weaker sections, but these provisions do not allow arbitrary denial of employment based on caste alone.", "You cannot absolutely stop the government from acquiring your land for a project if it chooses to do so by law, because under Article 300A, \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" The Constitution specifically saves laws providing for acquisition of estates or rights therein by the State (Article 31A), meaning such laws cannot be invalidated merely for abridging certain fundamental rights.\n\nHowever, where the law provides for acquisition of land personally cultivated by the owner and that land falls within the ceiling limits applicable under any law in force, the State cannot acquire such land, building, or appurtenant structure unless the acquisition law mandates payment of compensation \"at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof.\"\n\nThus, while the government has the authority to acquire land by law, you may contest unlawful acquisition procedures or demand compensation at not less than market value if applicable. Total prevention of acquisition is not guaranteed, but lawful protections and compensation requirements apply.", "No, it is not legal for a child below the age of fourteen years to be employed to work in any factory, mine, or engaged in any other hazardous employment. Article 24 of the Constitution explicitly states: \"No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.\" Furthermore, forced labor, including \"begar and other similar forms of forced labour,\" is prohibited as per Article 23, and any contravention is punishable by law. Therefore, a child being forced to work in a factory is illegal.", "All citizens have the right \"to freedom of speech and expression\" and \"to assemble peaceably and without arms.\" Therefore, if you are stopped from speaking at a protest, it is against your rights guaranteed under this protection.", "The Constitution guarantees \"equality before the law\" and \"prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\" under Article 14 and Article 15(1). It states: \"The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.\" However, Article 26 grants every religious denomination or any section thereof the right \"to manage its own affairs in matters of religion,\" subject to public order, morality, and health (Article 25(2)(b) and Article 26). \n\nThus, while the State cannot discriminate based on sex, a religious denomination has the constitutional right \"to manage its own affairs in matters of religion.\" This indicates that restrictions imposed by a religious institution on entry, including those based on sex, may be protected under its right to manage religious affairs, provided it does not violate public order, morality, or health.\n\nNo explicit provision in the given text states that a woman being barred from entry into a religious place is unconstitutional. The Constitution allows religious denominations to regulate religious matters internally, which may include entry rules, notwithstanding the general prohibition on discrimination by the State.\n\nTherefore, if a religious place stops you from entering because you are a woman, it is not necessarily unconstitutional under these constitutional provisions, given the special protection for religious denominations to manage their own affairs in matters of religion.", "Under Article 25, every person is entitled to \"freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject to public order, morality, and health. This guarantees the right to choose and change religion without government interference, provided that such freedom does not contravene public order, morality, or health. Therefore, the government cannot stop a person from changing their religion within these constraints.", "If the police torture someone in custody, it violates the \"Protection of life and personal liberty\" as stated in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees that \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\" Torture in custody infringes this fundamental right since it unlawfully deprives or threatens a person's personal liberty and life without due process.", "If you are denied admission to a public university because you belong to a backward community, you may seek relief under constitutional provisions that allow for special measures favoring socially and educationally backward classes. The Constitution permits the State to make provisions for the reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any backward class of citizens if, in the opinion of the State, that class is not adequately represented (Article 16(4)). Furthermore, Article 342A empowers the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes for each State or Union territory, which may receive special consideration.\n\nWhile Article 16(2) prohibits discrimination on grounds including caste in employment or public office, Article 16(4) explicitly allows for reservation to ensure adequate representation of backward classes. By analogy, similar principles apply to educational admissions where reservations are commonly implemented for such classes to ensure equality of opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, the Government may appoint Commissions to investigate and recommend measures for improving conditions of socially and educationally backward classes (Article 340). These commissions can suggest steps including reservation and other supports that States and Central Government can adopt.\n\nTherefore, if you face denial solely on the basis of being from a backward community, you may invoke constitutional protections and seek the benefit of reservations or any affirmative action measures as provided by law made under these constitutional provisions. The precise application would depend on the formal recognition of your class as socially and educationally backward in the relevant State list or Central list and applicable laws providing reservation in educational admissions."]}

Specifically, Article 16(4) of the Constitution states:\n\n\"Nothing in [Article 16] shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.\"\n\nMoreover, Article 342A empowers the President, in respect of any State or Union territory, to specify by public notification the socially and educationally backward classes in the Central List deemed to be backward classes in relation to that State or Union territory. Parliament and States may include or exclude classes from this list for the purposes of reservations and related provisions.\n\nTherefore, if you belong to a backward class specified under these provisions, the State can lawfully offer reservations or special provisions for admission to educational institutions, allowing you to claim the benefit of such reservation. Denial of admission solely on grounds of belonging to backward communities may be subject to these constitutional safeguards aimed at ensuring equality of opportunity and upliftment of backward classes.\n\nHowever, the exact procedures, admissions policies, and extent of reservation depend on the laws and notifications issued by the State and Central Governments according to these constitutional provisions.\n\nIf the denial is not in conformity with these provisions, there are constitutional safeguards to ensure that backward classes receive educational opportunities through reservations and related affirmative action."]}
