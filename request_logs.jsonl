Specifically, because the gravitational force acts as a centripetal force directed toward the sun's center and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the force can be resolved into components where the component perpendicular to the orbital path changes the direction without altering speed, maintaining the areal velocity. From his Proposition XIII (Theorem XIII), Newton deduces that under such a central force, the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This is because the force acting toward the center does not change the transverse (angular) component of motion, ensuring that the areal velocity remains constant. The mutual actions of planets being negligible, their orbits and areas described conform to this principle, confirming Kepler's Second Law from Newton's laws of motion and gravitation."]}

He shows this by considering the motion of a body subjected to successive impulses directed toward the center, which deflect the body from rectilinear motion into a curved path lying in one plane. In each equal increment of time, the body describes triangles of equal area formed by the radius vector and the line of motion. The composition of these equal area increments over time proves that the area swept out by the radius vector is proportional to time, thus equal areas are described in equal times. This arises fundamentally from the application of Newton\u2019s laws of motion\u2014specifically, that forces acting toward the center produce accelerations perpendicular to the body\u2019s instantaneous velocity without changing the magnitude of the velocity normal to that direction\u2014and from the law of universal gravitation which provides that the centripetal force is directed toward the center."]}

For example, in a body double in quantity with equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n\nIn contrast, \"force,\" specifically vis insita or innate force, is the power of resisting by which a body endeavors to persevere in its present state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line. Force is the cause impressed upon bodies to generate or alter true motion; quantity of motion is the measure of motion itself.\n\nThus, quantity of motion concerns the extent of motion combining matter and velocity, while force is the power or cause that generates or changes that motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are:\n\n1. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\n\n2. The alteration of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\n\n3. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are equal and directed to contrary parts.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws, combined with the principle of universal gravitation (that every particle of matter attracts every other with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance), explain and harmonize the motions of all bodies in the Solar System\u2014including planets, satellites, and comets. They describe how bodies move in their orbits due to gravitational forces, preserving motions unless acted upon, altering motions proportionally to forces, and involving equal and opposite reactions among interacting bodies.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by resolving the body\u2019s motion into two components: one directed towards the center (centripetal) and the other transverse (perpendicular) to that center. The centripetal force produces no change in the body's speed along its path but continually deflects it from a straight line, causing the curved orbit. By analyzing small segments of the orbit and using Corollary 2 of his Laws of Motion, Newton shows that the transverse motions are proportional to the angular motions of the radius vector. Because the centripetal forces act along the radius and the transverse motions correspond to angular velocity, the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times, thus proving Kepler's Second Law from his laws of motion and gravitation.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is directed to the sun and varies inversely as the square of the distance from that focus. He demonstrates that a planet acted upon by such a force moves in a conic section orbit and that this attracting force resides in every particle but operates as if concentrated at the centers of spherical masses. He proves that one spherical body acts upon another with a force directly proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Additionally, Newton confirms that the total gravitational force towards a whole planet arises from the sum of forces towards all its parts, each varying in reciprocal proportion to the square of their distances, thus establishing the inverse-square law of gravitation.", "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally is that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This universal gravitation arises because the force of gravity towards a whole body (such as a planet) is the sum of the forces exerted by all its component parts, and since every part gravitates towards every other part, all bodies must mutually attract each other. Newton demonstrated this through the motions of terrestrial bodies, the moon, and other celestial orbs, showing that the same law governs all matter from the smallest particle to entire planets and the Solar System.", "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets as arising from the gravitational forces these planets exert on each other. For example, the force of gravity from Jupiter on Saturn, although much weaker than Saturn's gravity toward the sun, is significant enough during their conjunctions to cause noticeable perturbations in Saturn's orbit. The magnitude of these perturbations depends on the relative strengths and distances of the gravitational forces involved. Saturn's orbit experiences more substantial perturbations from Jupiter than Jupiter's orbit does from Saturn. Other planets also cause mutual perturbations, but these effects are much smaller, except for the Earth's orbit being noticeably disturbed by the Moon. Newton also notes that these mutual attractions can cause changes in the orbital elements such as longitude and latitude, introducing perturbations that can alter the shape and orientation of planetary orbits over time.", "Newton used his invented BINOMIAL THEOREM and the method of fluxions, treating lines, surfaces, and solids as generated by motion and considering areas as nascent quantities increasing by continual fluxion proportional to the length of ordinates and uniformly increasing abscissae. He deduced velocities of generated quantities called fluxions and the quantities themselves called fluents, using infinite series to find ultimate values.\n\nHe did not use standard calculus notation because his differential method (fluxions) differed only in name and notation from Leibnitz's, who used the letter d. Newton called changing quantities moments or fluxions and did not adopt the \"d\" notation used by Leibnitz.", "Newton explains orbital motion by describing centripetal force as a force directed toward the center of the orbit that continuously draws a body inward, preventing it from flying off in a straight line. This force opposes the body's natural tendency to move away from the center due to inertia, thus retaining it in its curved path. He uses the example of a stone in a sling revolving with velocity, where the sling's pull toward the hand acts as the centripetal force keeping the stone in orbit. Similarly, in celestial bodies, centripetal forces directed toward central bodies cause planets to remain in their orbits. Newton treats these centripetal forces mathematically, allowing estimation of their effects, and notes that centripetal force can decrease in proportion to the square of the distance from the center, governing orbital motion.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media by considering resistance that is nearly proportional to the duplicate (square) ratio of velocity when distant particles act mutually with forces increasing as the square of velocity. In media whose particles do not mutually act with force at a distance, resistance is accurately in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. He shows that when a body moves through a medium like air or fluid, it encounters resistance proportional to the density ratio of the medium to the body, and this resistance acts over time intervals proportional to distances related to the body's size (e.g., lengths or diameters). The resistance arises because the motion of the body imparts motion to particles of the medium, consuming force, and this pressure from compression in a non-elastic, continuous fluid transmits instantly, producing resistance. Additionally, Newton analyzes resistance proportional to velocity, where the motion lost to resistance is proportional to the space traveled, and uniform resistances can be compounded with forces like gravity to describe motion in resisting media.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that absolute space remains always similar and immovable, providing a fixed frame where true motion occurs, whereas relative motion is the translation of a body from one relative place to another, dependent on the positions of bodies in relation to each other. Absolute time flows equably without regard to external factors, unlike relative or common time which is measured by observable motions. True or absolute motion is caused by forces impressed directly upon the moving body and involves actual changes in motion, while relative motion can be altered without forces acting on the body itself but rather on other bodies used for comparison. This distinction supports Newton's laws by establishing that true motion and forces are real and not merely relative phenomena, allowing the laws to describe actual physical changes rather than mere changes in observational relations.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.", "Apart from his grandfather Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty."]}

By analogy, similar principles apply to educational admissions where reservations are commonly implemented for such classes to ensure equality of opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, the Government may appoint Commissions to investigate and recommend measures for improving conditions of socially and educationally backward classes (Article 340). These commissions can suggest steps including reservation and other supports that States and Central Government can adopt.\n\nTherefore, if you face denial solely on the basis of being from a backward community, you may invoke constitutional protections and seek the benefit of reservations or any affirmative action measures as provided by law made under these constitutional provisions. The precise application would depend on the formal recognition of your class as socially and educationally backward in the relevant State list or Central list and applicable laws providing reservation in educational admissions."]}

Article 16(2) of the Constitution ensures that \"no citizen shall, on grounds only of ... caste ... be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.\" Furthermore, Article 17 abolishes \"Untouchability\" and forbids its practice in any form, declaring enforcement of any disability arising from untouchability an offence punishable by law. However, the State is permitted to make provisions for reservation of appointments or posts in favor of backward classes or economically weaker sections, but these provisions do not allow arbitrary denial of employment based on caste alone.", "No, it is not legal for a child below the age of fourteen years to be employed to work in any factory, mine, or engaged in any other hazardous employment. Article 24 of the Constitution explicitly states: \"No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.\" Furthermore, forced labor, including \"begar and other similar forms of forced labour,\" is prohibited as per Article 23, and any contravention is punishable by law. Therefore, a child being forced to work in a factory is illegal.", "Arresting a person without a warrant can be legal under certain conditions but includes strict safeguards. Upon arrest, the person must be:\n\n1. Informed \"as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest\" and must not be denied \"the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" (Protection against arrest and detention, Article 22(1))\n\n2. Produced \"before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate.\" The person cannot be detained beyond this period without magistrate authority. (Article 22(2))\n\nExceptions include persons who are \"enemy aliens\" or those arrested under laws providing for preventive detention. Preventive detention laws themselves impose additional restrictions, such as maximum detention periods not exceeding three months unless an Advisory Board of judges reports sufficient cause for extension. (Article 22(3,4))\n\nTherefore, arrest without a warrant is permissible provided these procedural protections and time limits are strictly followed. Detention without informing the reasons or legal representation, or detention beyond 24 hours without magistrate approval, is not lawful according to the constitutional safeguards outlined.", "If you are denied admission to a public university because you belong to a socially and educationally backward class, the Constitution provides that the State may make provisions for reservation in favor of such backward classes. Specifically, Article 16(4) of the Constitution states:\n\n\"Nothing in [Article 16] shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favor of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.\"\n\nMoreover, Article 342A empowers the President, in respect of any State or Union territory, to specify by public notification the socially and educationally backward classes in the Central List deemed to be backward classes in relation to that State or Union territory. Parliament and States may include or exclude classes from this list for the purposes of reservations and related provisions.\n\nTherefore, if you belong to a backward class specified under these provisions, the State can lawfully offer reservations or special provisions for admission to educational institutions, allowing you to claim the benefit of such reservation. Denial of admission solely on grounds of belonging to backward communities may be subject to these constitutional safeguards aimed at ensuring equality of opportunity and upliftment of backward classes.\n\nHowever, the exact procedures, admissions policies, and extent of reservation depend on the laws and notifications issued by the State and Central Governments according to these constitutional provisions.\n\nIf the denial is not in conformity with these provisions, there are constitutional safeguards to ensure that backward classes receive educational opportunities through reservations and related affirmative action."], "similarity_search_used": true, "cached_answers_count": 9, "new_answers_count": 1}
