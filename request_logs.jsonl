Essentially, it's the product of these two factors. The motion of an entire body is considered the sum of the motions of all its individual parts.", "Newton distinguished \"quantity of motion\" from \"force\" by defining them in relation to the properties of matter and motion.\n\nThe \"quantity of motion\" is defined as the measure arising from both the velocity and the quantity of matter in a body. This quantity is also proportional to the weight of the body, as determined by pendulum experiments.\n\n\"Force,\" on the other hand, is described as the impressed force upon bodies to generate motion. True motion is only generated or altered by such an impressed force. Newton also discusses \"absolute quantity of a centripetal force\" as a measure proportional to the efficacy of the cause propagating it from the center, with examples like magnetic force. Furthermore, he notes that \"motive force\" arises from the \"accelerative force\" multiplied by the quantity of matter, where accelerative force relates to motive force in the same way that celerity relates to motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are as follows:\n\n*   **Law I:** Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\n*   **Law II:** The alteration of motion is always proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.

He deduced the universal law of gravitation, which states that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distances. This principle was derived from observing the motion of the moon and Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, which Newton then demonstrated to be true through his own universal law.\n\nNewton's work, particularly \"The Principia,\" applied these laws to explain the movements of all bodies within the Solar System, including planets, satellites, and comets. This comprehensive understanding allowed him to explain and harmonize various phenomena previously considered inexplicable. For instance, the law of falling bodies at the Earth's surface was found to be the same as the force guiding the moon in its orbit. This allowed for the mapping of planetary movements and the trajectories of comets.\n\nThe application of these laws involves resolving motions into components. For example, when analyzing orbits, motions can be broken down into a component directed towards the center of attraction and a transverse component. The relative strengths of these components are dictated by the bodies' positions and angular motions.", "Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law from the laws of motion involves resolving the force acting on a body. When a force, such as IN, is resolved into two components \u2013 NT acting perpendicular to the path and IT acting along the path \u2013 the perpendicular component (NT) does not affect the body's velocity along its path. Instead, it causes the body to deflect from a straight course and follow a curved path. This force is entirely dedicated to this deflection. The other component (IT), acting along the direction of motion, is responsible for accelerating the body. Therefore, the accelerations produced in equal times are proportional to these force components. This analysis, when applied to the motion of bodies, lays the groundwork for understanding how centripetal forces, decreasing in a duplicate ratio of the distances from the center, govern celestial motion, as observed by figures like Sir Christopher Wren.", "The provided text chunks do not contain information detailing Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law from gravitation.", "In equal times, equal areas are described in one immovable plane.

Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the lineage of Sir Isaac cannot be definitively traced. There are family traditions suggesting their origin might be from Scotland or from Newton in Lancashire. His mother remarried after his father's death, and she was left to manage the Woolsthorpe estate and another property, relying on these for her and young Isaac's support.

This principle harmonizes the movements of all bodies within the Solar System, including planets, satellites, and comets.\n\nNewton demonstrated that the law governing falling bodies at the Earth's surface is the same as that guiding the moon in its orbit. This insight allowed him to map planetary movements and the paths of comets, extending the principles of motion across the vastness of space. The application of his laws allows for the analysis of orbital mechanics, such as resolving motion into components directed towards a central body and transverse to it, with the ratio of transverse motions being dependent on angular velocity.", "Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law from the laws of motion involves resolving the force acting on a body. When a force is resolved into two components, one acting perpendicular to the path of the body (like NT in Chunk 446) does not change the body's velocity along its path. Instead, it deflects the body from a straight course, causing it to follow a curved path. This force is entirely dedicated to this deflection. The other component of the force (like IT in Chunk 446) acts along the direction of the body's motion and is responsible for accelerating it. In equal time intervals, the accelerations produced are proportional to these force components.\n\nChunk 462 also touches upon resolving motion. It explains that if the motion of a body is resolved into two components\u2014one towards the center and another transverse to the former and perpendicular to the line from the center\u2014the motions towards the center are equal. The transverse motion of one body is then compared to the transverse motion of another body as the ratio of their angular motions.
