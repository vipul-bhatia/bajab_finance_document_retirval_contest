The notice should include particulars such as Policy Number, ID Card Number, Name of Insured Person, Nature of Disease/Injury, and Name and Address of the attending Medical Practitioner/Hospital. The final claim documents must be submitted within 15 days of discharge and include:\n\n- Original bills, receipts, and discharge certificate/card from the Hospital  \n- All documents pertaining to the illness starting from the date first detected (Doctor\u2019s consultation reports/history)  \n- Medical history recorded by the Hospital  \n- Original cash-memo from Hospital(s)/chemist(s) with proper prescription  \n- Original receipt, pathological and test reports supported by attending Medical Practitioner\u2019s note  \n- Certificates from attending Consultants/Specialists and Surgeon regarding diagnosis and operation  \n- MLC/FIR/Post Mortem/Disability/Death certificates if applicable  \n- Documents related to organ donation if applicable\n\nRegarding updating the dependent daughter\u2019s last name in the policy records after marriage, any change (including nomination changes) must be communicated to the company in writing and becomes effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made. Midterm inclusions such as newly wed spouse or added members are permitted upon payment of pro-rata premium and can be done within 90 days of marriage or at the time of renewal. Since the daughter has recently married, updating her status and name likely falls under these provisions.

Further, if the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries, or name of any State, the President must first refer the Bill to the Legislature of that State for its views within a specified period, and the Bill can be introduced only after the expiry of that period.\n\nThe power under Article 3 includes the power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting part of any State or Union territory to another State or Union territory. The term \u201cState\u201d in clauses (a) to (e) includes a Union territory, but in the proviso relating to reference to the State Legislature, it does not include a Union territory.\n\nThus, the amendment of boundaries, area, or name of a State is made by Parliament through legislation under Article 3, following the procedure of presidential recommendation and reference to the concerned State Legislature for views where applicable.", "According to Article 24 of the Constitution of India, \"No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.\" Thus, children below fourteen years of age are prohibited from working in hazardous industries such as factories or mines.", "Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the \"Protection of life and personal liberty,\" stating that \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\" This means that the State cannot take away a person's life or personal liberty except by following a legally established process. Article 21 is a fundamental right under Part III of the Constitution.\n\nThe significance of Article 21 lies in its safeguarding of life and personal freedom, ensuring that any deprivation of these can only happen through a lawful procedure. This right is subject to limitations imposed by law but cannot be suspended except as provided by the Constitution (e.g., suspensions during emergencies exclude Article 21, as the right under Article 21 is maintained even then).

In the case of economically weaker sections, such special provisions for reservation are in addition to existing reservations and are subject to a maximum of ten percent of the posts in each category.\n\nHence, under Article 15, the State can make special provisions specifically for women and children; socially and educationally backward classes; Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes; and economically weaker sections not included in the former categories.", "Article 11 of the Constitution allows Parliament to regulate the right of citizenship and override previous articles on citizenship (Articles 5 to 10).

Exceptions to these protections exist, such as for enemy aliens or persons detained under laws providing preventive detention, which themselves have specific procedural safeguards.

For example, in a body double in quantity with equal velocity, the quantity of motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. The quantity of motion is essentially the product of the mass (quantity of matter) and its velocity.\n\nIn contrast, \"force\" is defined in several related ways but is fundamentally distinct from quantity of motion. Newton defines \"vis insita,\" or innate force of matter, also called \"vis inertia,\" as \"a power of resisting,\" whereby every body endeavors to maintain its current state of rest or uniform straight-line motion. This innate force differs from inactivity only in our conception and acts as resistance or impulse when another force is impressed upon the body.\n\nAn \"impressed force\" is \"an action exerted upon a body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line\" and \"consists in the action only; and remains no longer in the body, when the action is over.\" Among impressed forces is the \"centripetal force,\" by which bodies are drawn or impelled towards a point as to a center.\n\nFurthermore, Newton distinguishes types of forces such as motive, accelerative, and absolute forces. The motive force relates to the body as an endeavor or propensity towards a center, arising from the parts taken together; accelerative force relates to the place of the body as a power diffused from the center; the absolute force relates to the cause or efficacy that propagates the force from the center through surrounding space.\n\nImportantly, the quantity of motion arises from velocity combined with quantity of matter, while motive force arises from accelerative force combined with quantity of matter. The sum of the actions of the accelerative force on the parts of the body constitutes the motive force of the whole.\n\nIn summary, \"quantity of motion\" is a measure of the motion in a body resulting from mass and velocity combined, while \"force\" is an action impressed upon a body, either as innate resistance to change or as an external agency that produces or changes motion. Force acts to change a body's state and is conceptually distinct from the quantity of motion which is a measure of motion itself.", "Newton\u2019s three laws of motion are stated as follows:\n\n1. **Law I:** \"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\" This means a body will maintain its current motion or rest until acted upon by an external force.\n\n2. **Law II:** \"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\" Specifically, a force generates motion proportional to its magnitude, whether impressed all at once or gradually. The motion caused is in the direction in which the force acts.\n\n3. **Law III:** \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\" In other words, forces between two bodies are equal and opposite.\n\n**Application in celestial mechanics:**\n\nNewton applied these laws to explain and harmonize the motions of celestial bodies\u2014planets, satellites, comets\u2014and to unify diverse previously inexplicable phenomena under a universal framework. He extended the law of falling bodies near the Earth\u2019s surface to the moon\u2019s orbit, identifying the master fact that the same force guiding terrestrial bodies governs celestial motions. This conceived the Universal Law of Gravitation: every particle attracts every other with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance.\n\nIn celestial contexts, the forces act as centripetal forces directed toward the centers of orbits, continually deflecting bodies from rectilinear courses into curvilinear paths while accelerating them proportionally (in line with Law II). The mutual gravitational forces between planetary bodies and their satellites are proportional to their masses and inverse squares of distances, explaining regular satellite motions.\n\nThe principles also establish that the common center of gravity of multiple bodies moves uniformly unless acted upon by an external force, preserving the system\u2019s overall motion (consistent with Law I). The mutual attractions produce equal and opposite forces, ensuring conservation of motion and momentum within systems (Law III). The motions of planets and their satellites thus arise naturally from these laws combined with the law of universal gravitation, rendering the entire solar system a connected mechanical system governed by these principles.\n\nIn sum, Newton\u2019s three laws define the behavior of bodies under forces, and when combined with universal gravitation, they enable precise calculation and understanding of planetary motions, satellite orbits, and comet trajectories, uniting terrestrial and celestial mechanics under one comprehensive theory.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law\u2014the law that a planet describes equal areas in equal times\u2014by analyzing the nature of forces and motions under his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Specifically, he considers a body moving under the influence of a centripetal force directed toward a fixed center. Newton resolves the centripetal force into two components: one perpendicular to the path of motion (which alters the direction but not the speed of the body) and one tangential to the path (which changes the body's velocity magnitude). The tangential component accelerates the body along its path, while the perpendicular component deflects it into a curved orbit.\n\nBy examining infinitesimal displacements and areas formed by the radius vector to the center of force and the orbiting body, Newton shows that these areas are generated proportionally to time. He uses geometric constructions and properties of conic sections to demonstrate that the increments of these areas produced in equal time intervals are equal, proving that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\n\nThis result fundamentally rests on the law that the force toward the center causes the motion to continually deviate from a straight line while preserving the rate of area swept out. Since the force is central (always directed toward the focus), the angular momentum-like quantity (area swept per unit time) remains constant. Newton employs the calculus of nascent increments of areas and motions and the decomposition of forces in line with his Laws of Motion\u2014\"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed\"\u2014to validate the equal areas law.\n\nThus, Newton demonstrates that a planet, under the inverse-square centripetal force of universal gravitation, moves so that the radius vector to the sun describes areas proportional to the elapsed time, which is precisely Kepler's Second Law.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by first inferring from the planetary motions that the force retaining a planet in orbit is always directed toward the sun and varies inversely as the square of its distance from the sun. He proved that a planet acted upon by such a force must move in a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola). \n\nHe showed this force (gravity) resides in every particle of matter but, for spherical masses, operates as if concentrated at their centers. Consequently, one spherical body acts on another with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter (mass) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. \n\nNewton further demonstrated that the force of gravity toward a whole planet arises from the sum of the forces exerted by each particle of the planet, each of which decreases in a duplicate (i.e., squared) ratio of the distance from that particle. He confirmed by refining propositions and corollaries in his Principia that the composite gravitational force from many particles still follows the inverse square law with regard to the distance between the centers of mass.\n\nThus, by analyzing planetary orbits, proving the allowable conic sections under an inverse square force, and showing that the forces from constituent particles combine to produce a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between centers, Newton establishes that gravity follows an inverse square law relative to distance.", "Newton's argument for the universal action of gravitational force on all masses is grounded in experimental observation, logical reasoning, and the principle of consistency across all bodies. He observed that all bodies about the earth gravitate toward the earth in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain; the moon similarly gravitates toward the earth according to its mass; the sea gravitates toward the moon; planets mutually gravitate one toward another; and comets toward the sun. From these observed mutual attractions, Newton concludes that \"all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.\"\n\nHe reasons that since gravity acts proportionally to the quantity of matter in terrestrial bodies of all forms\u2014verified by experiments such as pendulum trials\u2014and given that there is no fundamental difference in substance among bodies but only differences of modes and forms, these forces must universally exist in all bodies, celestial as well as terrestrial. The attractive force of the whole body arises from the sum of attractions toward its several parts, and though the mutual gravity between small bodies on Earth is not perceptible to the senses due to its relative weakness compared to Earth's gravity, it is nonetheless present.\n\nThus, Newton's grand generalization unifies the motions of all bodies in the Solar System\u2014planets, satellites, comets\u2014and even the minutest particles, maintaining a ceaseless, reciprocal influence between every particle of matter. This principle\u2014every particle of matter attracting every other particle with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance\u2014is the foundation of universal gravitation. It extends naturally from the law of falling bodies observed on Earth to the motion of the moon and the remote bodies of the system, grounding gravity as a universal, mutual phenomenon among all masses.", "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by considering the mutual gravitational attractions among the planets, each being bodies of the same sort attracting one another reciprocally according to the inverse square of the distance. Since all parts of a planet gravitate towards another planet proportionally to their matter, the total gravitational force between planets arises from the sum of the forces toward all their parts. \n\nBecause these gravitational forces do not act equally on all parts of a planet or system, differences in accelerative forces produce perturbations in their motions. Specifically, if accelerative attractions toward the greatest body are not reciprocally as the squares of the distances, unequal impulses acting on some bodies but not others necessarily change their relative situation, causing perturbations.\n\nFor example, Jupiter\u2019s gravity toward Saturn is significant though smaller compared to the sun\u2019s influence, and their conjunctions produce noticeable perturbations in Saturn\u2019s orbit. Similarly, Jupiter experiences perturbations by Saturn, though less significant because of the relative magnitudes of gravitational forces. Earth\u2019s orbit is also sensibly disturbed by the moon\u2019s motion about their common center of gravity.\n\nNewton thus accounts for perturbations as arising from the varying gravitational attractions among planets, compounded of the forces toward their parts, leading to inequalities in accelerative forces that alter orbital motions. Despite these mutual actions, the aphelions and nodes of the planetary orbits remain fixed because the planes of the orbits do not move appreciably. The mutual gravitational interactions produce inequalities and changes in orbits that, though real, are generally small except in some cases such as Jupiter and Saturn.", "Newton used the method of \"fluxions\" as the primary mathematical tool in the Principia, which was a precursor to calculus. He developed this method by first inventing the celebrated Binomial Theorem and then applying it to problems such as the rectification of curves, determination of surfaces and volumes of solids, and the position of their centres of gravity. He treated areas of curves as nascent quantities, increasing by continual fluxion in proportion to the length of the ordinate, with the abscissa increasing uniformly in proportion to time. He considered lines generated by motion of points, surfaces by motion of lines, solids by motion of surfaces, and derived velocities (fluxions) of these quantities by rules of infinite series. To the velocities of such quantities, he gave the name \"fluxions,\" and to the quantities themselves, \"fluents.\"\n\nNewton did not use standard calculus notation because he preferred the geometrical method over algebraical calculations. He censured the handling of geometrical subjects by algebraic techniques and expressed a strong, deeply marked preference for geometrical synthesis rather than analytical formulae. He chose to reduce demonstrations to the \"first and last sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities,\" that is, to the limits of those sums and ratios, rather than relying on the method of indivisibles, which, though more contracted, seemed somewhat harsh and less geometrical. Newton emphasized that if he used the concept of particles or little curve lines, he meant \"evanescent divisible quantities,\" not indivisibles, and always the limits of sums and ratios. This approach aligns with his intention to adhere to more geometrically rigorous reasoning rather than algebraic symbolism.\n\nThus, his avoidance of standard calculus notation reflected his philosophical and methodological preference for geometrical rigor and clarity, preferring synthetic demonstrations that avoid \"tediousness\" and maintain the tradition of geometric reasoning rather than the algebraic and algorithmic methods that came later.", "Newton explains orbital motion by using the concept of centripetal force as a force directed toward the center of the orbit that continuously opposes the natural tendency of a body to move in a straight line. He defines centripetal force as the force \u201cwhich restrains [a body] to, and detains them in their orbits,\u201d causing a body revolving in any orbit, such as a planet around the sun, to follow a curved path rather than a straight line. This force is always directed to the central point\u2014in planetary motion, the sun\u2014and causes the planet to sweep equal areas in equal times, consistent with Kepler\u2019s second law.\n\nNewton further deduces from Kepler\u2019s laws\u2014specifically that planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus\u2014that the centripetal force acting on a planet varies inversely as the square of its distance from the sun. He demonstrates mathematically that if a planet is acted upon by such a force, it can only move in a conic section orbit (circular, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic). He also shows that this attractive gravitational force resides in every particle of matter, but in spherical masses, it operates as if concentrated at their centers, leading to a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between centers.\n\nNewton\u2019s method involves resolving motions into components: one directed toward the center of force (centripetal) and one transverse to it, and examining their ratios relative to angular motions. He employs properties of geometry and proportions, such as the relations in similar triangles and the ratios of distances and velocities, to derive the law of centripetal force governing circular and elliptical orbits. For example, in circular motion, he relates the centripetal force to elements of the circle, tangents, and chords, establishing the force\u2019s dependence on the radius and other geometric parameters.\n\nBy formulating these geometric and proportional relationships, Newton mathematically traces the magnitude and direction of centripetal forces from observed planetary motions, thereby explaining how planets are retained in stable orbits through a force that continuously pulls them toward the central body, preventing their departure along a straight path.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the forces of resistance exerted upon bodies moving through those media and how these forces relate to velocity, fluid properties, and body characteristics. He identifies that resistance arises principally from the inertia (or \"inactivity\") of the matter composing the fluid, which resists the motion of the body by generating motion in the fluid\u2019s parts, creating resistance.\n\nKey points of Newton's treatment include:\n\n1. **Resistance Proportional to the Square of Velocity:**  \n   In fluids like air and water, the resistance that a body meets when moving swiftly is nearly in the \"duplicate ratio\" of its velocity, meaning resistance is proportional to the square of velocity. This is shown by bodies projected in elastic fluids meeting resistance approximately proportional to the squares of their velocities and diameters combined.\n\n2. **Dependence on Fluid and Body Properties:**  \n   The resistance depends on the size (diameter) and density of both the body and the fluid. Bodies of similar shape and density moving through similar fluids experience resistances proportional to the squares of their diameters and the densities of the fluids relative to the bodies.\n\n3. **Different Cases of Resistance Based on Particle Interaction:**  \n   - If the particles of the medium are \"reflected\" by the body, the resistance is greatest.  \n   - If the particles are not reflected but move along with some velocity imparted by the body, the resistance is half as great.  \n   - For intermediate cases where particles fly back with some intermediate force, the resistance lies between these two extremes.\n\n4. **Pressure and Fluid Compression:**  \n   The pressure caused by the compression of a fluid, if propagated instantaneously throughout a continuous, non-elastic fluid, does not generate motion in the fluid parts and so does not affect resistance. Inertia (the \"force of inactivity\") is principally responsible for resistance, not the pressure of compression alone.\n\n5. **Uniformity of Orbits in Rotating Fluids:**  \n   When analyzing spheres rotating uniformly in fluids divided into concentric orbs, Newton deduces that for uniform motion to persist, the forces (impressions) on both sides of each orb must be equal and opposite, preventing acceleration or retardation of motion. This approach reflects his method of equating forces acting within layers of fluid to understand fluid resistance effects.\n\n6. **Resistance Arises Partly from Fluid Density, Tenacity, and Attrition:**  \n   Newton distinguishes three components of resistance: from density of the medium (duplicately proportional to velocity), from the tenacity of the fluid (uniform with respect to time, or proportional to the moment of time), and from attrition.\n\n7. **Inertia and Resistance:**  \n   He defines resistance partly as arising from the inertia (\"vis inertia\" or \"force of inactivity\") of matter, where a body resists change to its state of motion and this resistance manifests as drag or friction-like forces in resisting media.\n\nOverall, Newton models motion in resisting media by considering the mechanics of particle interactions, fluid properties, relative densities, and velocity dependencies, leading to the conclusion that resistance is predominantly proportional to the square of velocity, modulated by the characteristics of both the moving body and the resisting fluid.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs fundamentally from relative motion in that absolute space and time exist independently and uniformly, without relation to external objects, while relative motion depends on the positions and movements of bodies relative to one another.\n\nSpecifically, \"absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external,\" and is called duration. In contrast, relative time is \"some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion,\" like hours or days, which serve as common substitutes for true time.\n\nLikewise, \"absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.\" Relative space, conversely, is \"some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces,\" determined by the position of bodies and often mistaken for immovable space.\n\nMotion is also distinguished accordingly: \"Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into another,\" whereas relative motion is the translation \"from one relative place into another.\" For example, a body at rest relative to a moving ship may be truly moving absolutely if the ship itself moves through absolute space.\n\nNewton emphasizes that true, or absolute, motion is accompanied by forces impressed upon the body, whereas relative motion may change without any force on the body itself, merely by changing the reference bodies. True motion \"suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving body,\" but relative motion \"does not necessarily undergo any change\" by such forces.\n\nThis distinction supports Newton's laws of motion by grounding them in absolute space and time, which provide a consistent, immovable framework to define true rest and true motion. Such absolute measures allow for the identification of actual forces causing changes in motion, as opposed to perceived changes that arise purely from varying relative positions. Therefore, Newton's laws rely on the concept of absolute space and time to precisely define and analyze true motion and the forces acting upon bodies.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.

Two family traditions exist: one claiming Scotch extraction, and the other that the family originally came from Newton in Lancashire, having lived for a time at Westby in Lincolnshire before moving to Woolsthorpe about a century prior to Isaac Newton's birth.

Arthritis, gout and rheumatism\" under the domiciliary hospitalisation benefit, which covers medical treatment taken at home when hospitalisation is required but not feasible due to circumstances like non-availability of beds.\n\nTherefore, despite the treating Medical Practitioner confirming medical necessity and unavailability of hospital beds, domiciliary treatment expenses for arthritis are excluded from coverage.", "The claim for expenses on a prosthetic device after hip replacement surgery is payable only if the prosthesis is \"an artificial device or prosthesis which is a necessary part of the Treatment immediately following Surgery for as long as such device or prosthesis is required by medical necessity.\" Prostheses or medical appliances not required intra-operatively for the illness/injury for which the insured was hospitalized are not payable. \n\nRegarding the hospital bill items post-discharge:  \n- The cost of a lumbar belt (lumbo sacral belt) is payable only if the patient has undergone surgery of the lumbar spine.  \n- The cost of a walker falls under \"walking aids charges\" which are explicitly stated as not payable.  \n\nTherefore, payable items are the prosthetic device if medically necessary as part of the surgery or immediate recuperation, and the lumbar belt only if the surgery was on the lumbar spine.

This is explicitly stated for IONM under the list of Modern Treatment Methods and Advancement in Technology.\n   - IONM is classified among modern treatments which are subject to the limits specified in the Policy Schedule. The policy restricts coverage for 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI guidelines to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI) unless a different limit is specified in the Schedule.\n   - Thus, the IONM expense will be limited either by the specific limit for IONM stated in the Policy Schedule or by the modern treatment ceiling of 50% of the Sum Insured if no specific limit is noted.\n\n2. **Critical Care and ICU Expenses:**\n   - ICU charges include expenses for ICU bed, general medical support, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges.\n   - ICU is defined as a hospital section with constant supervision by dedicated medical practitioners, equipped for continuous monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients requiring life support facilities, with care and supervision more sophisticated than ordinary wards.\n   - ICU charges are payable up to the category or limit specified in the Policy Schedule or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less.\n   - Room rent for ICU is limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), inclusive of nursing charges. If the insured opts for admission in a higher category than the stipulated limit, the insured bears the difference proportionally to the final hospital bill.\n\n3. **City Population-Based Limits:**\n   - Although explicit numeric limits for treatment expenses based on city population are not detailed in the provided information, ICU bed count requirements differ by city population: hospitals in towns with population under 1 million must have at least 10 inpatient beds; in other places (over 1 million population), at least 15 inpatient beds.\n   - The policy\u2019s coverage for ICU and related medical expenses is subject to room category limits and policy schedule limits, which would apply regardless of city size but the hospital infrastructure requirements vary.\n\n4. **Other Relevant Conditions:**\n   - All medical expenses must be medically necessary, prescribed by a qualified Medical Practitioner, and conform to professional standards.\n   - Expenses are paid based on reasonable and customary charges that should not exceed what would be payable if uninsured and should align with charges by similar hospitals/doctors in the locality.\n   - Claims for IONM and other advanced treatments must follow the process specified under relevant policy clauses.\n   - The overall maximum liability of the insurer per policy year is limited to the Sum Insured chosen and shown in the Policy Schedule.\n\nIn summary, the insured\u2019s expenses for IONM during brain surgery are limited to the sub-limit for IONM or 50% of the Sum Insured as per modern treatments coverage, while ICU expenses are covered up to the category or limit defined in the Policy Schedule with ICU room rent restricted to 4% of the Sum Insured. All these are subject to medical necessity, reasonable and customary charges, and proportionate deductions if room rent chosen is higher than the limit.", "To add a newly-adopted child aged 3 years as a dependent under the policy, the following process and eligibility criteria apply:\n\n1. **Addition Procedure:**  \n   - The policyholder must submit a written request for endorsement to add the dependent.  \n   - The insurer will add the child as an Insured Person only after the application for cover is accepted by the insurer.  \n   - Additional premium for the dependent must be paid on a pro-rata basis, corresponding to the risk coverage duration for the child.  \n   - The insurer will issue an endorsement confirming the dependent\u2019s addition, which becomes effective from the later of the date the request is received or the date premium is received.\n\n2. **Eligibility Criteria for Child Dependents:**  \n   - Children between 91 days and 18 years of age are eligible to be covered provided either or both parents are concurrently covered under the policy.  \n   - Children above 18 years continue coverage up to 26 years provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.  \n   - Although specific mention of adoption is not detailed, the classification of \"dependent children\" as covered includes children meeting the age criteria with parents covered.  \n   - Newborn babies are accepted subject to notification by the last day of the month following birth and premium receipt, which establishes precedent for timely notification and premium payment.\n\n3. **Circumstances for Refusal of Cover:**  \n   - The insurer may refuse addition if the application for cover is not accepted by them.  \n   - Failure of the policyholder to pay the premium owed including the additional premium within the grace period can lead to termination of cover and denial of benefits.  \n   - Cover termination also occurs if the dependent ceases to be dependent as per the policy definition unless otherwise specifically agreed.  \n   - Generally, renewal will not be denied solely on the ground of claims history or prior claims.\n\n4. **Definition of Dependent:**  \n   - Dependents include children as defined above, and adding or deleting dependents must be promptly notified by the policyholder in writing, with endorsement by the insurer.\n\n5. **Additional Notes:**  \n   - The policy allows addition of new dependents during the policy period only when the above conditions are met.  \n   - Dependents can be deleted effective from specific events such as employee leaving or death. Refunds of premium for deleted dependents are pro-rata and contingent on no claims paid or outstanding for that dependent.\n\nIn summary, the policyholder must apply in writing and pay applicable pro-rata premiums for adding a newly-adopted child (aged 3) as a dependent during the policy period. The insurer must accept the application and issue an endorsement. The child is eligible as a dependent if aged between 91 days and 18 years with a parent covered. Cover may be refused if the application is not accepted or premiums remain unpaid. Cover ends if the child ceases to be a dependent as per policy terms.", "For a day care cataract procedure involving hospitalisation less than 24 hours, the claim is processed as per the day care treatment provisions. The insured person should notify the Third Party Administrator (TPA) for claim intimation using the toll-free number on the health ID card, keeping the ID number handy. Since it is a planned hospitalisation in a network hospital, intimation to the TPA must be given at least 48 hours prior to admission. Pre-authorisation is required for cashless treatment in network providers; however, for a day care cataract surgery, which is a recognized day care treatment performed under local or general anesthesia lasting less than 24 hours, the insured should produce the ID card and complete the cashless request form through the network provider. The TPA will verify and issue pre-authorisation valid for 15 days to undergo treatment at the network provider. Payment under cashless facility will be made directly to the network hospital.\n\nIf reimbursement is sought instead, the insured must submit the original documents within the prescribed timelines. For hospitalisation or day care treatment reimbursement claims, documents must be submitted within 15 days of discharge. The claim documents must be in the insured person's name only and include duly filled claim form, photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, attending physician\u2019s certificate about diagnosis and nature of operation with dates, investigation reports, original hospital bills with detailed breakup, payment receipts, implant invoices and stickers (such as lens sticker for cataract), diagnostic reports with prescriptions and bills, medicine bills with prescriptions, discharge summary, pre- and post-operative imaging reports, and indoor case papers detailing medical history and treatment progress.\n\nFor the complication arising after two weeks requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, the insured person must pay upfront as non-network hospitals do not provide cashless facilities. The insured should notify the TPA in writing about the hospitalisation event within the prescribed timelines\u2014notification is required either within 24 hours of emergency hospitalisation or before discharge in case of planned hospitalisation. Reimbursement claim documents must be submitted within 15 days of discharge for hospitalisation expenses, and supporting documents for pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses within 15 days from completion of treatment.\n\nThe documents required for the non-network hospital inpatient claim are similar and include the completely filled claim form, photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, attending doctor\u2019s certificate for diagnosis and procedure details with dates, investigation reports, original detailed hospital bills and receipts, discharge summary, medical history, diagnostic and medicine bills with prescriptions, indoor case papers with nursing sheet, and cheque copy or bank statement for payment details. All documents must be in the insured\u2019s name. Additional assistance such as medical examination by authorized representatives and verification of documents may be required.\n\nIf any deficiency in submitted documents is found during scrutiny, the insured will be notified and must rectify the deficiency within 10 working days from first intimation, else the claim may be rejected.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Day care cataract procedure in network hospital: Notify TPA at least 48 hours prior; obtain pre-authorisation; produce TPA ID card at admission; cashless payment directly to network hospital; for reimbursement, submit prescribed original documents within 15 days post discharge including medical certificates, bills, prescriptions, discharge summary, implant details, imaging reports.\n\n- Post-operative complication after two weeks requiring 5 days inpatient care in non-network hospital: Pay hospital upfront; notify TPA in writing within 24 hours of emergency or before discharge for planned hospitalisation; submit original claim documents within 15 days from discharge (including claim form, photo ID, medical certificates, detailed hospital bills, discharge papers, diagnostic and medicine bills with prescriptions, indoor case papers); claim processed on reimbursement basis; respond to any document deficiency within 10 working days.\n\nThis claim process ensures compliance with notification timelines and detailed documentary evidence requirements to validate and settle claims for both day care and subsequent inpatient complications.", "If an insured mother with maternity cover is admitted for a complicated caesarean section, the maternity expenses covered include \"medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections incurred during hospitalisation).\" The newborn baby born during the policy period will be covered from birth under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted. However, acceptance of the newborn as an Insured Person is \"subject to written notification on or before the last day of the month following the birth of the child and receipt of the agreed premium.\"\n\nThe newborn is considered covered from birth up to 90 days of age, subject to these notification and premium payment conditions. Treatment expenses for the newborn, including intensive care if required, will be covered as part of the policy only if the newborn is accepted as an insured person under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover.\n\nRegarding exclusions, the policy excludes all expenses traceable to contraception, sterilization, assisted reproduction, gestational surrogacy, reversal of sterilization, and also excludes treatments related to external congenital anomalies or defects. Routine eye examinations and treatments not medically necessary are also excluded. There is no specific exclusion stating that intensive care expenses for a newborn who expires within 24 hours would not be covered if the newborn is accepted and premiums paid.\n\nTherefore, for the newborn who expires within 24 hours and required separate intensive care, the claim eligibility for the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses depends on:\n\n1. The newborn being accepted as an insured person by submission of written notification to the insurer on or before the last day of the month following birth.\n\n2. Payment/receipt of the agreed premium for the newborn cover.\n\n3. Treatment expenses must be medically necessary and incurred following medical advice.\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, the policy covers expenses for the newborn, including ICU charges, which are defined as \"the amount charged by a Hospital towards ICU expenses including ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing and intensivist charges.\"\n\nIf the newborn is not notified or premiums for the newborn cover are not paid, no liability arises for the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses.\n\nIn summary, the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses, including intensive care following a complicated C-section delivery, are eligible for claim only if the newborn is formally added to the policy by notification and premium payment within the prescribed time limit. The mother\u2019s maternity cover ensures maternity expenses including complicated delivery charges are covered, but the newborn\u2019s individual intensive care expenses require separate newborn cover adherence. There is no exclusion applicable preventing claim payment for newborn intensive care or treatment following birth complications or early demise if all conditions are met.", "A claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment supported by a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient.\n\nJustification:\n\n1. Eligible Practitioners / Mental Health Professionals:\n- A \"Medical Practitioner\" is defined as a person holding a valid registration from the Medical Council of any State or India, entitled to practice medicine within its jurisdiction.\n- A \"Psychiatrist\" is a medical practitioner possessing a postgraduate degree or diploma in psychiatry awarded or recognized by the University Grants Commission, National Board of Examinations, or Medical Council of India.\n- A \"Clinical Psychologist\" is a person with a recognized qualification in Clinical Psychology from an institution approved by the Rehabilitation Council of India or holding specified postgraduate qualifications recognized by it.\n- A \"Mental Healthcare Professional\" includes a psychiatrist, a professional registered with the concerned State Authority, a professional with specified postgraduate degrees in Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, Siddha related to mental health, or a Clinical Psychologist.\n- Importantly, a prescription to support claims for medical treatment must be from the attending \"Medical Practitioner,\" i.e., a registered medical doctor.\n\n2. Claim Document Rules:\n- Claims must be supported by a prescription from the attending medical practitioner (i.e., a qualified medical doctor as per definition) for all medical treatments and investigations.\n- Submission of discharge certificate/summary from the hospital is required.\n- Other relevant documents include medical history, diagnostic reports, medicine bills with prescriptions, and identification documents.\n- The \"treating Medical Practitioner\" must give prescriptions for medical history, tests, and treatment to be considered valid.\n- The discharge summary is usually from the hospital, not only a mental health professional.\n\n3. Implication:\n- A prescription from a general practitioner (a medical practitioner) is valid, but a discharge summary certified only by a registered Clinical Psychologist (who is not a medical doctor) does not fulfill the criteria of documentation from the attending medical practitioner or hospital discharge documents.\n- Psychiatric inpatient treatment generally requires involvement of a psychiatrist (medical doctor) or hospital documentation.\n- Since only a Clinical Psychologist certified discharge summary is provided, it lacks the treatment certification of a recognized medical doctor specializing in psychiatry or hospital.\n\nTherefore, the claim documents must include a discharge summary from the hospital or treating medical practitioner (psychiatrist or general medical practitioner) along with the prescription. A discharge summary certified solely by a Clinical Psychologist is insufficient.\n\nIn conclusion, for inpatient psychiatric claims, the policy requires the prescription to be from a medical practitioner (e.g., a psychiatrist or GP) and the discharge summary must be hospital-origin or from a medical practitioner; a discharge summary certified only by a Clinical Psychologist does not meet the claim document requirements.", "ECG electrodes are payable with specific constraints: up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting the operation theatre (OT) or ICU. For longer ICU stays, a change is allowed, and at least one set every second day is payable.\n\nGloves are not explicitly listed as a payable item in the annexures provided. There is no mention of gloves being admissible as a reimbursable expense during oral chemotherapy sessions or hospital visits.\n\nOral chemotherapy expenses are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. For submission and reimbursement, all claims must be supported by the treating Medical Practitioner's prescription and relevant documentation.\n\nTherefore, ECG electrodes used during each session are admissible under the specified limits related to OT/ICU visits, but gloves used are not covered for reimbursement according to the annexures.", "Pre-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less, can be claimed provided these expenses relate to the same Illness or Injury for which in-patient hospitalisation was accepted. The policy defines \"Any one illness\" as a continuous period of illness including relapse within 45 days from the date of last consultation with the hospital where treatment was taken. Therefore, pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission are within the permissible timeframe and eligible for claim reimbursement.\n\nPost-hospitalisation medical expenses incurred following discharge are also covered up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, provided the claim for in-patient hospitalisation has been accepted and the expenses are related to the same Illness or Injury. Post-hospitalisation expenses must be incurred within the specified period after discharge. Since the infection requiring diagnostics and pharmacy expenses arose 20 days after discharge, these expenses are eligible for claim if they fall within the post-hospitalisation limit in days as specified in the policy.\n\nAll claims for pre- and post-hospitalisation medical expenses are subject to the same conditions: they must be related to the same Illness or Injury for which hospitalisation was claimed, and must be submitted in the prescribed time frame, typically within 15 days from completion of treatment for post-hospitalisation expenses. The claim process follows Clause VI.3 and VI.4 as defined in the policy.\n\nPharmacy expenses prescribed by the treating Medical Practitioner and diagnostic procedures directly related to the Illness are covered under the hospitalisation benefit, including during pre- and post-hospitalisation phases.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission can be claimed if they are related to the same illness and within the policy-specified pre-hospitalisation period and amount limits.\n\n- The post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge relating to the infection requiring diagnostics and pharmacy expenses can be claimed if within the policy-specified post-hospitalisation period and amount limits, and the hospitalisation claim has been accepted.\n\n- Both pre- and post-hospitalisation claims must be duly submitted as per prescribed procedures and time limits indicated in the policy.\n\n- The definition of \"Any one illness\" includes continuous illness and relapse within 45 days, supporting aggregation of related expenses within that timeframe.\n\nHence, both sets of expenses can be claimed if compliant with the policy's specified time limits and amount limits for pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses and related to the same illness for which hospitalization was claimed and accepted.", "Coverage for a dependent child who turns 27 during the policy period, with the premium paid at the beginning of the coverage year, continues until the point when the dependent ceases to be eligible as per policy terms or the end of the policy period. Specifically, coverage for children above 18 years continues along with the parents up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Once the dependent attains age 27 (i.e., after turning 26), they cease to be a dependent under the policy unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.\n\nUpon ceasing to be a dependent (such as by crossing the age limit), coverage will end unless a specific agreement provides continuation till the policy period end. Deletion from the policy follows the protocol where the Policyholder must notify the insurer of such membership changes on or before the last day of the succeeding month. Coverage will terminate immediately if the policyholder stops paying premiums or at the expiry of the policy period as shown in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.  \n\nTherefore, if a dependent child turns 27 during the policy year and the premium was paid upfront for the full policy period, coverage will generally continue only until the date they cease to be a dependent (i.e., their 27th birthday or just after age 26) unless there is a specific arrangement allowing continuation until the policy period ends. After ceasing eligibility, the insured dependent will be deleted per the policy\u2019s membership change notification protocol, effective from the date they cease to be a dependent or as otherwise specified. Coverage ends immediately upon termination conditions such as cessation of dependent status.", "When the insured opts for a single private room that costs more than the allowed room rent limit, the reimbursement of associated medical expenses\u2014including diagnostic and specialist fees billed separately\u2014is governed by the \"Proportionate Clause.\" According to this clause, the reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses incurred at the hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible room rent per day bears to the actual room rent per day charged. This means that the insurer will proportionately reduce the reimbursement of all associated expenses based on the ratio of the policy room rent limit to the actual higher room rent chosen.\n\nSpecifically, the clause states:  \n\"In case of admission to a room at rates exceeding the limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance (for Clause III.A.1.A), the reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses incurred at the Hospital shall be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.\"\n\nHowever, proportionate deductions will not apply if the hospital does not follow differential billing based on room category or for expenses where differential billing is not adopted based on the room category.\n\nThe relevant clause governing this is Clause III.A.1.A and the associated \"Proportionate Clause\" detailed under medical expenses associated with room rent limits.\n\nDiagnostic tests and specialist fees charged separately are considered part of the associated medical expenses and thus subject to this proportional reimbursement calculation.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Room rent expenses above the policy limit will cause a proportional reduction in reimbursement of all associated medical expenses.\n- Diagnostic and specialist fees are reimbursed on this same proportional basis.\n- If the hospital does not differentiate billing by room category, the proportionate clause does not apply.\n- This is established under the \"Proportionate Clause\" referencing room rent limits as specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance, specifically clause III.A.1.A.", "If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insurer will first intimate the deficiency to the Insured Person. The Insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to submit or complete the necessary documents. The insurer may send up to three reminders during this period. If the deficiency is not met or only partially met within these 10 working days, the insurer may at its discretion deduct the amount related to the deficient documents and settle the claim for the valid part.\n\nIf the Insured resubmits the required documents after 10 days, the claim reassessment and settlement process continues. The insurer shall settle claims or communicate rejection, explicitly mentioning the grounds, within 15 days from the receipt of the last necessary document.\n\nIf the claim is finally rejected, the insurer will communicate the rejection decision in writing within 15 days from receiving the final documents or investigation report. Upon receiving the rejection, the Insured Person has the right to represent (contest) the decision for reconsideration within 15 days from the date of receipt of the rejection communication.\n\nThus, the course of action is: promptly submit the required documents within 10 working days of the deficiency notice; if delayed, the claim may be partly settled excluding the deficient part; once final rejection is communicated, the insured may contest the decision by sending a representation within 15 days of receipt.\n\nThe timelines are:\n- 10 working days for document resubmission after deficiency intimation.\n- 15 days for claim settlement or rejection decision after receipt of all necessary documents.\n- 15 days for the insured to contest (represent) against the final rejection decision.\n\nIf the insured contests the final rejection, they must do so within this 15-day period following the insurer\u2019s written rejection notice.", "The claim for hospitalization of 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, where the procedure typically required more than 24 hours before technological advances, would be eligible under the definition of \"Hospitalisation\" provided. \"Hospitalisation means admission in a Hospital for a minimum period of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours except for specified procedures/treatments, where such admission could be for a period of less than 24 consecutive hours.\" This implies that coverage includes surgeries and procedures facilitated by modern treatment methods or technological advancements that reduce required hospital stay to less than 24 hours.\n\nThe relevant category is \"Modern Treatment Methods & Advancement in Technology,\" which recognizes that certain surgeries or procedures previously requiring longer hospital stays may now be done with shorter hospitalization due to technological advances. Claims related to such procedures are subject to limits as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.\n\nIn summary, the claim is eligible if:\n\n- The surgery is conducted in a hospital meeting policy definitions.\n\n- The procedure qualifies under modern treatment methods or technological advancements.\n\n- Hospitalization for less than 24 hours is acceptable for specified procedures like the minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia.\n\n- The claim limits and conditions specified under the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance are met.\n\nTherefore, hospitalization for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery, which previously required more than 24 hours, is covered as per the policy\u2019s recognition of modern treatments that allow shorter hospital stays.", "When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, the hospital must meet the following minimum infrastructure requirements to qualify under this policy:\n\n- Have qualified nursing staff employed round the clock.\n- Have at least 10 in-patient beds.\n- Have qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock.\n- Have a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out.\n- Maintain daily records of patients and make these accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.\n\nIn contrast, for metropolitan areas (or towns with a population of 1 million or more), the difference in the minimum requirement is that the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds instead of 10.

This sub-limit applies regardless of whether the procedure is done as an inpatient hospitalization or as a day care treatment.\n\nDay Care Treatment is defined as medical or surgical procedures undertaken under general or local anesthesia in a hospital or day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would otherwise require hospitalization exceeding 24 hours.

The coverage is available under modern treatment methods and advancement in technology benefits, with sub-limits as indicated in the policy schedule for claims involving robotic surgeries.\n\nOther modern treatment methods and advancements have limits per surgery, generally up to the policy limit as specified in the schedule, and the same approach applies for robotic surgeries in cancer treatment.\n\nNo separate or different sub-limits were provided specifically distinguishing day care versus inpatient robotic surgery for cancer; both are covered up to the specified limit in the policy schedule or certificate of insurance for robotic surgeries related to malignancies.\n\nTherefore, robotic surgery for cancer is covered both as a day care procedure and inpatient hospitalization, with a maximum limit per policy period as specified in the policy schedule, without an explicit different sub-limit for day care versus inpatient status. The claim is subject to the overall robotic surgery limit under the policy for malignancies.", "In the event of an accident requiring air ambulance evacuation followed by inpatient admission, the following steps and mandatory requirements apply for pre-authorization and claims assessment:\n\n**Pre-Authorization:**\n- Emergency medical evacuations such as air ambulance must be notified to the insurer immediately via their call centre or in writing.\n- Emergency medical evacuations shall be pre-authorised by the insurer.\n- The insurer\u2019s team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of the emergency evacuation or repatriation. Coverage is payable only if this prior authorization is obtained before treatment starts.\n- The Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer if there is any change in diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost during hospitalization.\n- The insurer or their authorized TPA reserves the right to deny pre-authorization if the insured fails to provide relevant medical details; denial of pre-authorization does not imply denial of treatment or coverage.\n\n**Claims Assessment:**\n- Claims for air ambulance cover become payable if an inpatient hospitalisation claim under the policy is admitted for the same illness or injury.\n- Claims related to hospitalisation are assessed after verification that pre-authorization has been utilized and dues with the Network Provider have been settled.\n- The insurer will assess admissible claims in order: application of proportionate clause, co-pay, medical expense limits/sub-limits, and any opted deductibles.\n- The insurer pays amounts directly to the Network Provider; the insured must settle any non-admissible expenses, costs above sub-limits, co-payments, or deductibles with the hospital.\n- The insurer or TPA may scrutinize claim documents and require additional information or medical examination of the insured if necessary.\n\n**Mandatory Documentation Required:**\n- Medical records including diagnosis, nature of operation (if any), and date of diagnosis.\n- Investigation test reports supported by prescriptions from the treating medical practitioner.\n- Complete medical history and previous consultation papers relevant to the ailment.\n- Original hospital bills with detailed breakup and payment receipts.\n- Discharge certificate or summary from the hospital.\n- Photo ID and age proof, health card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n- Original invoice and payment receipt for any surgical implants used.\n- All original diagnostic reports with medical prescriptions and invoices from diagnostic centers.\n- Original pharmacy bills with medical prescriptions.\n- Police MLC/FIR copy in accidental cases.\n- If applicable, death summary and death certificate for death claims.\n- Pre- and post-operative imaging reports if relevant.\n- Authorization to obtain medical and hospital records as required by the TPA/insurer.\n\n**Additional Conditions:**\n- The insured person must permit medical examination by the insurer\u2019s authorized medical practitioner if requested.\n- Any deficiency in documents must be rectified within 10 working days of intimation.\n- Claims are admissible only if all terms, conditions, and premium payment obligations under the policy are fulfilled.\n- Treatment and evacuation must follow the directions and medical advice of the treating medical practitioner.\n\nFollowing this process ensures that claims related to air ambulance evacuation combined with inpatient hospitalisation are duly pre-authorized and correctly assessed with all mandatory documentation in place.", "The policy excludes expenses related to treatment of specific illnesses, including knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis (other than caused by an accident), under a specific waiting period. This waiting period applies until the expiry of the number of months of continuous coverage counted from the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer.\n\nIf the insured person had prior continuous coverage without any break as defined under the applicable IRDAI portability norms, the waiting period for the same specific illness is reduced to the extent of the prior coverage. In other words, the insured benefits from the accrued continuity of coverage and the waiting period is correspondingly shortened.\n\nHowever, if there is an enhancement in the Sum Insured, the exclusion (waiting period) applies afresh on the increased sum insured amount. Also, if the specific illness falls under the waiting period specified for pre-existing diseases, the longer of the two waiting periods applies.\n\nThus, for a knee replacement due to osteoarthritis, if the insured recently ported to this policy from a different insurer with uninterrupted prior coverage, the specific illness waiting period will be reduced by the duration of that prior coverage, effectively granting continuity benefits as per IRDAI portability guidelines.", "If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, the expense will be covered only if the treatment is \"Medically Necessary.\" \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" is defined as any treatment, tests, medication, or hospital stay which (i) is required for medical management of the illness or injury, (ii) does not exceed the level of care necessary to provide safe, adequate, and appropriate medical care, (iii) has been prescribed by a medical practitioner, and (iv) \"must conform to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India.\"\n\nHowever, coverage excludes \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment,\" which means treatments, including drug experimental therapy, \"which is not based on established medical practice in India,\" i.e., treatments that are experimental or unproven.\n\nTherefore, if the imported medication is part of a treatment recognized as medically necessary and not experimental or unproven under these definitions, the costs incurred during hospitalization will be payable, subject to usual policy limits and conditions.\n\nIn summary, coverage hinges on:  \n- The medication/treatment must be medically necessary as per the stated criteria.  \n- The treatment must not be \"Unproven/Experimental\" (i.e., not lacking established medical practice recognition in India).\n\nIf the imported medication falls under unproven or experimental treatment, expenses will not be covered. \n\nRelevant clauses include the definition of \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" and the exclusion of \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment,\" along with the general inpatient hospitalisation expenses cover conditioned on medical necessity prescribed by a registered medical practitioner.", "If a member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period, coverage for their dependents may continue until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy specifies that in case of death of an employee/member, dependents can be retained on coverage until the policy expires, unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till the end of the policy period. This continuation is subject to notification by the policyholder and any applicable endorsements.\n\nTherefore, dependents do not lose coverage immediately upon the death of the insured member; rather, they have the option to maintain coverage until the policy's expiration date. Refunds of premium on a pro-rata basis may be possible if no claims are outstanding concerning the insured person or their dependents.\n\nIn summary:\n- Upon death of a member in a non-employer group policy, dependents\u2019 coverage may continue until policy expiry at the insured\u2019s option.\n- Continuation requires the insured\u2019s choice and proper notification.\n- Coverage terminates at policy expiry unless specifically agreed otherwise.\n- Pro-rata premium refunds are possible if no claims exist.\n\nNo other options for continued coverage beyond the policy period or special provisions are outlined in the provided text.", "For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the claim must be supported by the original invoice with payment receipt along with the implant stickers for all implants used during surgery. Specifically, for stents used in angioplasty surgery, the stent invoice and the corresponding implant sticker are required as part of the claim documentation.\n\nIf only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may not meet the documentation requirements, as the insurer explicitly requires the original invoice \"with implant stickers\" for all implants used. This suggests that submitting an invoice lacking the implant sticker could lead to rejection or non-admissibility of the claim related to the implanted device.\n\nIn summary:\n- Supporting documentation must include the original invoice, payment receipt, and implant stickers corresponding to the implanted devices.\n- The absence of implant stickers on the invoice (i.e., providing only a generic invoice) may adversely affect the claim's eligibility for reimbursement.", "Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement when the insured person requires \"home nursing arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to visit the patient's home to give expert nursing services immediately after hospital treatment for as long as is required by medical necessity,\" and when such services are recommended by the specialist who treated the patient. This applies in post-hospitalisation care, provided that an inpatient hospitalisation claim for the related illness or injury has been accepted. Post-hospitalisation medical expenses, including home nursing, will be covered on a reimbursement basis up to the limits and number of days specified in the policy schedule, following the discharge from hospital related to the same illness or injury.\n\nThe following documentation is required to support such reimbursement claims:\n\n1. Duly completed claim form.\n\n2. Photo ID and age proof of the insured person.\n\n3. Health card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n\n4. Attending medical practitioner's or surgeon's certificate stating the diagnosis, nature of operation performed, and date of diagnosis.\n\n5. All original inpatient case papers with nursing sheets detailing medical history, treatment details, and the insured person's progress.\n\n6. Discharge certificate or summary from the hospital.\n\n7. Original final hospital bill with detailed breakup and all original deposit and final payment receipts.\n\n8. Original invoices and payment receipts for diagnostic tests, medicines, and other hospital services used during treatment.\n\n9. Medical practitioner's prescription for the home nursing services, indicating medical necessity.\n\n10. MLC/FIR copy if the injury is accidental.\n\n11. Bank details such as cheque copy or first page of bank passbook not older than three months.\n\nClaims must be submitted within stipulated time limits: reimbursement of post-hospitalisation expenses, including home nursing, must be claimed within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.\n\nHome nursing charges are payable as part of post-hospitalisation care but general attendant charges or service charges where nursing charge is also charged are not payable separately.\n\nIn summary, home nursing charges are reimbursable when ordered by the treating specialist as medically necessary after hospital discharge following an accepted inpatient claim, supported by complete and original documentation including detailed bills, prescriptions, discharge certificates, and case papers, and submitted within the defined time limits.", "In a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the procedure is as follows:\n\n1. The Insured Person may file the claim settlement under any one of the multiple policies held, choosing which insurer to treat as the primary Insurer.\n\n2. If the coverage under the selected primary policy is insufficient to cover the full admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will request details of other policies available to the policyholder.\n\n3. The primary Insurer will then coordinate with other Insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective policies. This coordination is done provided a written request for such coordination has been submitted by the Insured Person.\n\nRegarding claim settlement and documentation:\n\n- The claim documents must include original hospital bills with detailed breakup, all payment receipts, prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner, discharge certificate/summary, original diagnostic reports, original medicine/pharmacy bills along with prescriptions, and other relevant documents such as indoor case papers, photo ID, health card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n\n- In cases where the claim is settled under multiple policies and original documents have been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified copies of documents and claim settlement advice certified by the other insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.\n\n- The claim will be assessed, and settlement (including possible rejection) will be done within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.\n\n- Claims administration requires adherence to full and timely premium payment, medical examination if requested, submission of claims based on medical advice, and cooperation with the insurer's investigation.\n\n- Payment to the insured or nominee shall constitute a valid and full discharge of the insurer's liability for the amount paid.\n\nThus, the procedure involves the Insured filing a claim under any chosen policy, the primary insurer coordinating with other insurers for any shortfall beyond its coverage upon receipt of a written request, supported by comprehensive original or duly certified claim documentation, followed by timely assessment and settlement.", "Expenses for hospitalization undertaken primarily for evaluation and diagnostics only, where all tests and imaging are negative leading to a decision for no treatment, are not claimable under this policy. Specifically:\n\n- \"Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)\" excludes (i) expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only; and (ii) any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment.\n\n- Expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.\n\n- Hospitalisation means admission in a Hospital for a minimum period of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours (except specified procedures), and claims require medically necessary treatment, not merely diagnostic evaluation.\n\n- The treatment must be \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" and follow the written medical advice.\n\nTherefore, if hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative with no subsequent treatment undertaken, the medical expenses incurred are excluded and not claimable under the policy.", "The insurer requires that any change of nomination be communicated to the Company in writing, and such change becomes effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the death of the policyholder, the Company pays the nominee as named in the Policy Schedule, Policy Certificate, or in any endorsement if applicable. If there is no subsisting nominee, the Company pays to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder, whose discharge is treated as full and final settlement of its liability under the policy.\n\nIf a request to update the nominee is made after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and no prior endorsement for nominee change exists, the policyholder (or legal heirs in case of the policyholder's death) must communicate the nomination change in writing. The insurer will then assess the endorsement request; additional information, documents, or premium may be required, and the change will be effective only upon endorsement of the policy. Therefore, until an endorsement is made, the last recorded nominee remains effective, and post-demise nominee updates require proper endorsement procedure triggered by a written request.", "Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization, in the following scenarios based on definitions and exclusions provided:\n\n1. Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or medical appliances which are **not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized** are excluded from coverage.\n\n2. Any treatment or part of treatment that is not of reasonable charge or is not medically necessary is excluded; this implicitly includes prostheses or appliances that are not medically necessary.\n\n3. Prosthetic devices or medical appliances that are not part of or immediately following surgery, or not required as a necessary part of treatment, are excluded.\n\n4. Appliances or prostheses used for conditions or treatments excluded by the policy, such as alternative treatments or treatments without hospitalization, are not covered.\n\n5. Medical devices and appliances related to excluded conditions or treatments such as treatments for alcoholism, drug or substance abuse; treatments for refractive error under 7.5 dioptres; dental dentures except those related to accidents requiring minimum 24-hour hospitalization, and similar exclusions apply.\n\n6. Prostheses or medical appliances associated with treatment received outside India are not covered.\n\n7. Appliances or devices such as instruments for Sleep Apnea Syndrome (e.g., C.P.A.P.), oxygen concentrators for bronchial asthma, infusion pumps, or any other external devices used during or after treatment are excluded.\n\n8. Any prosthesis or medical appliance that is not certified by the attending medical practitioner as medically necessary is excluded.\n\nIn summary, coverage is limited to prostheses and medical appliances that are medically necessary, involved intra-operatively, or part of immediate post-surgical treatment, excluding all others even if related to hospitalization.", "Expenses for inpatient care for mental illness received from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally will not be reimbursed. Reimbursement and coverage apply only if the AYUSH hospital is registered with local authorities wherever applicable, complies with prescribed criteria, and is recognized as a hospital under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010 or equivalent enactments. A recognized AYUSH Day Care Centre or hospital must have qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioner(s) in charge and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurer. The presence of qualified practitioners alone is insufficient; local registration and compliance with all minimum criteria\u2014including registration as a hospital\u2014are mandatory for claims to be eligible for reimbursement. Therefore, if the AYUSH hospital providing inpatient mental illness treatment lacks local registration, expenses incurred there are not eligible for reimbursement.", "If an insured requests a cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate, the hospital/provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA. Specifically, in the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the network provider is required to secure new pre-authorization in accordance with the prescribed process. This ensures the cashless eligibility is maintained. The treatment must be within the network provider and pre-authorization is necessary before proceeding with the updated treatment plan.", "If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, the pre-hospitalization medical expenses cover claim is processed only after the decision on the main hospitalization claim has been made. Specifically, the policy states that \"the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after decision of the main Hospitalisation claim.\"\n\nFurthermore, for pre-hospitalization expenses to be admissible and reimbursable, they must be related to the same illness or injury for which the inpatient hospitalization claim is made, and the inpatient hospitalization claim must be accepted. The date of hospital admission for this benefit aligns with the first admission date relevant to the same illness or injury.\n\nIn summary, the assessment sequence requires the inpatient hospitalization claim to be approved first; only after that can pre-hospitalization expenses be assessed and processed for payment. This ensures that pre-hospitalization claims are contingent upon the admissibility and acceptance of the main hospitalization claim.", "The policyholder's contact details are as follows:\n\n**Policyholder Name and Address:**\nM/S DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA  \n4TH FLOOR, 1, BLOCK A, DLF INDUSTRIAL AREA, SECTOR 32, FARIDABAD, HARYANA 121003\n\n**Agent Contact:**\nName: JYOTI SAWROOP DUTTA  \nAgent Code: AGI0002616  \nMobile/Landline Number: 9419231737  \nEmail: jyoti.sawroop2111973@gmail.com\n\n**Company Contact (United India Insurance Company Limited):**  \nAddress: OPPOSITE PRESENTATION CONVENT SCHOOL, NH 21 - C/B GANDHI NAGAR, JAMMU - 180004, JAMMU AND KASHMIR  \nPhone: (191) 2432540, (191) 2435199  \nEmail: [Email not specified directly]\n\n**Customer Service Email for Information, Service Requests and Grievances:**  \n110600@uiic.co.in\n\n**For ID Cards & Claim Intimations:** Contact the TPA mentioned below.\n\n**Third Party Administrator (TPA) Contact Details:**  \nName: VIDAL HEALTH TPA PRIVATE LTD / TPA00019  \nAddress: SJR I Park, Plot No: 13,14,15, Tower 2, 1st floor, EPIP Area, Whitefield, Bangalore - 560066  \nToll-Free Numbers: 18604250251, 08046267018, 08046267070, 18001203348  \nWebsite: www.vidalhealthtpa.com  \nEmails:  \n- General Enquiries and Cashless Approval: help@vidalhealthtpa.com  \n- Claim Intimation: Intimation@vidalhealthtpa.com  \n- Grievances: greivances@vidalhealthtpa.com  \n\nAdditional communication related to the policy must be made in writing to the address of the Company or through electronic modes at the contact address specified in the Policy Schedule.\n\nNo insurance agents, brokers, or other persons are authorized to receive notices on behalf of the Company unless explicitly stated in writing.\n\nThus, all official communications should be directed to the Company or designated TPA contacts as specified above.", "Automatic approval of all claims is not described as a process to be wholly implemented, but the claim process involves several steps that can be streamlined through electronic document submission and scrutiny. Claims must be supported by necessary documents, which are electronically collected for settlement or denial. The Third Party Administrator (TPA) or insurer scrutinizes the claim form and accompanying documents, and any deficiency must be notified to the Insured Person or Network Provider. If deficiencies are not rectified within 10 working days of the first intimation, the insurer may, at its discretion, deduct the amount related to the deficiency and settle the claim if otherwise valid.\n\nClaims are assessed for admissibility based on terms like proportional clause application, applicable co-pay, limits or sub-limits, and opted deductibles. Settlement or rejection occurs within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document. For certain claims requiring pre-authorisation (e.g., orthodontic treatment for dependent children), claims are processed only after authorization and verification of dues with the Network Provider.\n\nThe insurer pays fixed or indemnity amounts as specified in the policy, and pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses are processed only after the main hospitalisation claim is decided.\n\nWhile the TPA handles claim admission and assessment, claim settlement and rejection remain with the insurer. Examination of the insured by medical practitioners may be requested as part of claim scrutiny.\n\nTherefore, to \u201capprove all claims automatically,\u201d the process would require:\n\n1. Electronic submission and collection of all necessary claim documents.\n\n2. Automated scrutiny of claim documents to identify deficiencies with prompt intimation and a limited rectification window.\n\n3. Predefined rules applied systematically to assess admissibility, such as co-pay, limits, deductibles, and proportionate clauses.\n\n4. Integration with Network Provider confirmations regarding pre-authorisation utilization and dues clearance.\n\n5. Expedited settlement decision within 15 days of complete document receipt.\n\nHowever, full automatic approval without any human or discretionary intervention is not detailed; discretion may be exercised, especially if deficiencies exist.\n\nHence, complete automatic approval can be approached by automated document handling, timely deficiency management, systematic application of policy rules, and rapid processing after receipt of all necessary documentation and verifications, but claims settlement and rejection decisions remain with the insurer and are subject to checks and balances including possible discretion.", "For a claim with missing documents, the insurer will scrutinize the claim form and accompanying documents and will intimate the insured person of any deficiency. If the deficiency in the necessary claim documents is not fully met within 10 working days of the first intimation, even after up to three reminders, the insurer may, at its sole discretion, deduct the amount related to the deficient documents and settle the remainder of the claim if it is otherwise valid under the policy.\n\nIn the case of forged or fraudulent documents, if any claim is found to be in any respect fraudulent, or if any false statement or declaration is made or any fraudulent means or devices are used by the insured person or anyone acting on their behalf to obtain benefit under the policy, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Any amount already paid against such fraudulent claims must be repaid by all recipients/policyholders who made that particular claim and are jointly and severally liable for the repayment. The insurer will not repudiate a claim on the ground of fraud if the insured person can prove that the misstatement was true to the best of their knowledge without deliberate intention to suppress material facts or that such misstatements/suppression were known to the insurer.\n\nThe claim, including rejection or settlement, will be assessed and decided within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.

Coverage for scheduled caesarean delivery at an out-of-town hospital not in the company\u2019s approved list:\n\nMaternity expenses, including caesarean section delivery, are payable under the Diamond and Platinum Plans only if the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital/nursing home in India. The company\u2019s liability per delivery (including caesarean) is limited to 2.5% of the Sum Insured. The plans require continuous coverage for 24 months and eligibility conditions such as having fewer than two living children apply. There is no explicit mention that maternity expenses are covered at hospitals outside the approved network or out-of-town hospitals. Since network hospitals are defined as those enlisted by insurer/TPA to provide cashless services, and non-network are those not part of this network, any expense in excess of negotiated prices or reasonable charges will not be borne by the insurer. Pre- and post-natal expenses are covered only if treatment is taken as in-patient in hospital/nursing home in India. Therefore, coverage for scheduled caesarean delivery is admissible only if treatment is taken as in-patient in hospital/nursing home in India; no explicit provision for coverage at out-of-town or non-network hospitals is mentioned, implying that such coverage may not be available or will be restricted in terms of claim settlement (e.g., no cashless facility, reimbursement subject to terms).\n\n2. Mid-term dependent inclusion for a newborn:\n\nNewborn baby cover is available from day one only on payment of requisite premium. The policy covers a newborn child from day one or at the time of renewal of the policy. Inclusion mid-term for newborn depends on specific approval and premium payment. The newborn baby cover provides medical expenses incurred for treatment taken in hospital as in-patient from day one, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy. However, members subsequently added (including newborns) have certain exclusions applying from the date of their inclusion. No detailed step-by-step process is provided, but it implies that mid-term inclusion is possible on payment of premium within 90 days for a newly wed spouse or for newborn from day one or at renewal. This suggests that mid-term inclusion for a newborn is possible if notified and premium paid within the stipulated period.\n\n3. Process to change communication email for the primary insured:\n\nChanges such as nomination or communication details must be communicated to the company in writing and become effective only when endorsement on the policy is made.

Notification of claim and any changes should be given within specified times (e.g., claims notified within 48 hours of admission, changes communicated promptly). Specific detailed steps for changing the communication email are not explicitly detailed, but the process involves submitting a written request to the company and getting an endorsement on the policy for effectivity.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Scheduled caesarean delivery coverage requires treatment as an in-patient in a hospital/nursing home in India; coverage for out-of-town hospitals not on the approved list is not explicitly supported and may be limited or reimbursed subject to terms and customary charges.\n\n- Mid-term inclusion of a newborn dependent is possible by notifying the company and paying the requisite premium from day one or at renewal, with exclusions applying from the date of inclusion.\n\n- To update the communication email for the primary insured, a written request must be made to the company, and the change will be effective only when endorsed on the policy; grievance/redressal contacts are provided for assistance.", "To submit a claim for prosthetic limb implantation after an accident for a dependent, the insured person must provide immediate notice of claim with details including Policy Number, ID Card No., Name of Insured Person, nature of injury, and attending medical practitioner's details within 48 hours of admission but before discharge, unless waived.

For post-hospitalization treatment (up to 60 days), supporting documents must be submitted within 15 days of completion.\n\nIf multiple policies are held, the insured may choose any policy for claim settlement; the chosen insurer acts as the primary insurer and must settle the claim within policy limits. If the sum insured under one policy is exhausted or insufficient, the primary insurer will coordinate with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy terms without causing hassles. Claims disallowed under one policy may be claimed under others independently, subject to their terms. Benefit-based policies allow claims from all insurers for the insured event. Restoration of sum insured may apply automatically to the extent of claim amount, subject to plan limits.\n\nRegarding dependent coverage for prosthetic implants, the policy does provide coverage for dependent children. However, some benefits like Accidental Death Benefit and Total Permanent Disability are not applicable for dependent children.

Prompt submission of information is expected (immediately but not later than one hour from the receipt of request), and cashless final bill authorization is done within three hours of receipt of discharge authorization from the hospital.\n\nFor psychiatric care coverage of a dependent child, the policy covers mental illness hospitalization only under specific conditions: illness must be as defined under the mental illness clause, hospitalization must be in a Mental Health Establishment, and must be advised by a Mental Health Professional (a psychiatrist or a qualified professional registered under the concerned State Authority or holding specified postgraduate degrees). Mental conditions related to alcohol or drug abuse, mental retardation and its complications, or psychological counseling and therapies not requiring hospitalization are excluded.\n\nRegarding the critical illness survival benefit details, for critical illnesses such as cancer, a survival benefit becomes payable to the insured person subject to conditions:  \n- The benefit is not available for illnesses the person is already suffering from at the time of first opting for this cover.  \n- The benefit is payable only once during the lifetime of the insured person for a particular disease.  \n- The amount payable depends on survival time post hospital discharge:  \n\u2003\u2022 On survival for 180 days and above: 15% of sum insured under the policy.  \n\u2003\u2022 On survival for 270 days and above: 5% of sum insured (and for certain benefits 10% is mentioned, depending on the plan).  \n(Exact percentages vary per plan or section with possible amounts listed as A: 15%, 5%, and 10%; B: 25%, 10%, and 15% of sum insured\u2014refer to plan details.)\n\nFor cancer diagnosis under the critical illnesses covered, the policy defines \"Cancer of Specified Severity\" as a malignant tumor characterized by uncontrolled malignant cell growth invading and destroying normal tissues, with histological evidence confirmed by a pathologist.

The objective of this investment commitment was to improve the production capacity of semiconductor chips manufactured in Wisconsin and to expand related advanced manufacturing capabilities in the United States to strengthen the domestic technology infrastructure.", "The new policy imposes a 100 percent tariff on computer chips and semiconductors manufactured abroad. However, companies that manufacture within the United States are exempt from this tariff. The purpose of the policy is to stimulate domestic manufacturing and reduce dependency on foreign semiconductor supplies. This measure aims to support American technological self-sufficiency and innovation.\n\nRegarding the impact on consumers and the global market, the policy is likely to limit availability of certain foreign-made video chips and thereby increase domestic production. It may provoke retaliatory trade restrictions from other countries, potentially leading to increased costs. For example, companies like Apple and Google, mentioned as major players, might experience supply challenges or cost increases due to this tariff, which could affect product prices and market dynamics globally.\n\nIn summary, consumers might face higher prices or limited access to some products due to increased costs from tariffs and retaliation. Globally, the market could experience increased trade tensions and disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain as this policy drives shifts toward domestic production but also elicits countermeasures."], "similarity_search_used": false, "cached_answers_count": 0, "new_answers_count": 5, "document_name": "doc_334ef1720708"}
