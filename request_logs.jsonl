Force, on the other hand, consists in the action only to change a body's state of rest or uniform motion and remains no longer in the body when the action is over; it is distinct from quantity of motion in that motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the quantity of matter, whereas quantity of motion arises from the velocity drawn into the quantity of matter.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: Law I states that every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion in a right line unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon; Law II states that the alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed; Law III states that to every action there is always opposed an equal reaction, or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts. In celestial mechanics, these laws explain the motions of planets, satellites, and comets by showing that bodies move in orbits due to forces directed toward centers, with motions resolved into components toward the center and transverse to it, and that the universal law of gravitation governs the reciprocal influences among all bodies in the solar system, harmonizing their diverse motions.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by showing that when a centripetal force acts successively on a body moving in a plane, the areas described by the radius vector from the center to the body in equal times are equal, as the triangles formed by these successive positions and the center are equal in area; thus, in equal times, equal areas are described in one immovable plane. This follows from resolving the force into components perpendicular and parallel to the path, where the perpendicular component deflects the body from a rectilinear course without changing its speed, causing the body to move in a curved orbit such that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times.", "Newton demonstrates that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is always directed to the sun and varies inversely as the square of its distance from that focus, showing that a planet acted upon by such a force moves in a conic section orbit. He further demonstrated that this attracting gravitational force resides in every particle but operates in spherical masses as if confined to their centers, so that one sphere acts upon another with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.", "Newton's argument for universal gravitational force is that since all bodies about the earth gravitate towards it in proportion to their quantities of matter, and similarly all planets, moons, and comets mutually gravitate towards one another according to their matter, it follows that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. This universal gravitation arises from the forces of gravity towards all parts of a body, compounded from the attractions of its several parts, and since there is no difference of substance among bodies but only of modes and forms, the attractive forces must be found in all sorts of bodies celestial as well as terrestrial, proportional to their quantities of matter.", "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits arises because the accelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest body (the sun) are not reciprocally as the squares of the distances from that body, causing unequal forces that change the relative motions of the planets. For example, the gravitational force of Jupiter on Saturn during conjunction causes a perturbation in Saturn's orbit that is significant enough to puzzle astronomers, while the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit by Saturn is much less, and other planetary perturbations are even smaller except for the Earth's orbit being sensibly disturbed by the moon.", "Newton used the method of fluxions, which involved considering areas as nascent quantities increasing by continual fluxion in proportion to the length of the ordinate and supposing the abscissa to increase uniformly with time, treating lines, surfaces, and solids as generated by motion and deducing velocities of these quantities from the equation of the curve using infinite series and his binomial theorem. He did not use standard calculus notation because his differential method was the same as the method of fluxions except in name and notation, with Newton calling quantities fluxions or moments and not employing the letter d to denote differences as Leibnitz did.", "Newton explains orbital motion by defining centripetal force as a force directed towards the center of the orbit that restrains a body from flying off in a straight line, thus retaining it in its orbit, analogous to the force that draws a stone towards the hand when swung in a sling. He further shows mathematically that planets are retained in their orbits by centripetal forces decreasing in a duplicate ratio of the distances from the centers, allowing the bodies to revolve uniformly around these centers under such forces.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media by stating that a body moving swiftly meets with a resistance nearly in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, meaning the resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity. He explains that projectiles excite a motion in fluids due to excess pressure at the fore parts compared to the hinder parts, and this resistance in every fluid is as the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid, proportional to the density of the medium and the body, thereby retarding the motion of the body accordingly.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that absolute space remains always similar and immovable without regard to anything external, while relative space is a movable dimension or measure determined by position relative to bodies; similarly, absolute time flows equably of itself and is distinct from relative, apparent, and common time which are sensible measures of duration by means of motion. This distinction supports his laws by allowing the definition of true and absolute motions as translations out of immovable places, with causes and effects\u2014such as forces impressed upon bodies\u2014distinguishing true motion from relative motion, thereby grounding the laws in absolute quantities rather than merely relative measures.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. Beyond Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot with certainty be traced.", "Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot with certainty be traced. Two family traditions existed: one that they were of Scotch extraction, and the other that they originally came from Newton in Lancashire, dwelling for a time at Westby, county of Lincoln, before moving to Woolsthorpe about a hundred years before Isaac Newton's birth."]}
