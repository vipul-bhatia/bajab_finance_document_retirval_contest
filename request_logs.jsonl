This implies that claims related to Non-infective Arthritis will not be payable until after the insured has completed a waiting period of four years from the start of the policy. There is no indication that Non-infective Arthritis is excluded entirely; rather, it is subject to this specified waiting period.", "You renewed your policy yesterday and have been a customer for the last 6 years. Regarding raising a claim for Hydrocele under your Family Medicare Policy:\n\n1. Hydrocele is listed under the \"Specific Disease/Procedure Waiting Period\" with a two-year (24 months) waiting period for claims related to its treatment (Chunk 41, Table A, point 8).\n\n2. The waiting period for such specific diseases or procedures applies from the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer and requires continuous coverage without any break (Chunk 40 and 41).\n\n3. Since you have been continuously covered for 6 years (which is more than 48 months), the waiting period for Hydrocele treatment would have expired, provided there has been no break in coverage and the condition was declared and accepted at the time of application (Chunk 40, point d).\n\n4. Additionally, the policy states that for pre-existing diseases, expenses related to treatment are excluded until the expiry of 48 months of continuous coverage after the date of inception of the first policy (Chunk 39). Hydrocele is considered under specific diseases with a 24-month waiting period, which is shorter than the 48 months for pre-existing diseases.\n\n5. If your coverage has been continuous without any break as defined under the portability norms stipulated by IRDAI, the waiting period for Hydrocele would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage (Chunk 40 and 41, point c and e).\n\n6. Renewal of the policy is ordinarily allowed, and renewal shall not be denied on the ground that the insured had made claims in preceding years (Chunk 58). Also, renewal within the grace period of 30 days maintains continuity of benefits without break in policy (Chunk 58).\n\nIn summary, since you have continuously held the policy for 6 years and renewed it recently, you are beyond the 24-month waiting period for Hydrocele. Therefore, you can raise a claim for Hydrocele treatment under your policy, assuming the condition was declared and accepted at the time of application and there has been no break in coverage.", "The policy covers expenses towards lawful medical termination of pregnancy during the policy period, except for voluntary medical termination of pregnancy during the first twelve weeks from the date of conception, which is not covered.

Further, if the Bill affects the area, boundaries, or name of any State, the President must refer the Bill to the Legislature of that State for expressing its views within a specified period or any further period allowed by the President, and that period must have expired before introduction of the Bill.\n\nIn this Article, \"State\" includes a Union territory in clauses (a) to (e), but in the proviso regarding the Bill's introduction and reference to the State Legislature, \"State\" does not include a Union territory.\n\nThus, the power conferred on Parliament by Article 3 includes the power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting a part of any State or Union territory to any other State or Union territory.\n\nThis is the constitutional provision under which Parliament can alter the boundaries, area, or name of an existing State.", "Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of fourteen years in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment.

There is no direct mention or explanation of theft, stolen vehicles, or the corresponding legal case category in the given excerpts. Therefore, based solely on the provided material, it is not possible to determine what case a stolen car would fall under in law.", "An arrest without a warrant can be legal provided certain constitutional safeguards are followed. Upon arrest and detention in custody, \"every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate,\" and no person shall be detained beyond this period without magistrate authority. Additionally, \"no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest,\" and shall not be denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of their choice.\n\nHowever, these protections do not apply to persons who are enemy aliens or those arrested or detained under laws providing for preventive detention, which have their own procedural safeguards including communication of grounds and opportunity to make representations.\n\nFurthermore, no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except \"according to procedure established by law,\" ensuring that any arrest and detention must conform to legal procedures.\n\nTherefore, arrest without a warrant is not per se illegal, but it must comply with the constitutional requirements of prompt production before a magistrate, informing the arrested person of the grounds of arrest, and allowing legal consultation. Detention beyond twenty-four hours without magistrate authorization is prohibited. Exceptions exist only under specific laws relating to preventive detention or enemy aliens.\n\nNo information is provided in the text about the legality of arrest without a warrant beyond these procedural protections.", "No, denying a job to someone solely on the grounds of caste is not allowed. Article 16 of the Constitution guarantees \"equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.\" It explicitly states that \"No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.\" Furthermore, Article 17 abolishes \"Untouchability\" and forbids its practice in any form, making the enforcement of any disability arising out of \"Untouchability\" an offence punishable by law. Therefore, discrimination in employment based solely on caste is prohibited and punishable under the Constitution.", "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. Laws providing for the acquisition by the State of any estate or rights therein, or the taking over of management of property by the State in the public interest, are not void merely because they abridge rights under Articles 14 or 19. However, where such a law provides for acquisition of land held under personal cultivation within the ceiling limit, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire such land, building, or structure unless the law provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof.\n\nTherefore, if the government takes your land for a project, you cannot stop it outright if the acquisition is authorized by law. The acquisition must be done by authority of law, and compensation must be paid at not less than market value, especially if the land is personally cultivated and within ceiling limits. The Constitution saves such laws from being invalidated on grounds of inconsistency with fundamental rights, provided they have received the President's assent when made by a State Legislature.\n\nIn summary, you cannot prevent the government from acquiring your land if it is done under a valid law, but you are entitled to compensation at or above market value, and certain protections apply to personally cultivated land within ceiling limits.", "No, it is not legal for a child below the age of fourteen years to be employed to work in any factory. Article 24 of the Constitution of India explicitly states: \"No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.\" Additionally, Article 23 prohibits forced labour, including \"begar and other similar forms of forced labour,\" making any contravention an offence punishable by law. Therefore, forcing a child to work in a factory is both prohibited and punishable under the law.", "All citizens have the right \"to freedom of speech and expression\" and \"to assemble peaceably and without arms\" (Right to Freedom, Article 19(1)(a) and (b)). Therefore, being stopped from speaking at a protest would be against these fundamental rights. However, the text does not provide details on any exceptions, limitations, or conditions under which these rights may be restricted. Hence, based solely on the provided information, preventing a person from speaking at a protest infringes upon their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.", "The Constitution guarantees \"equality before law\" and \"equal protection of the laws\" to every person within India (Article 14). It prohibits discrimination by the State on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth (Article 15(1)). No citizen shall, on these grounds, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition (Article 15(2)).\n\nHowever, Article 25 grants every person the \"freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject to public order, morality, and health. Furthermore, Article 26 provides that every religious denomination or any section thereof has the right \"to manage its own affairs in matters of religion,\" including establishing and maintaining institutions for religious purposes.\n\nArticle 15(3) explicitly states that \"Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children,\" indicating allowance for certain special provisions.\n\nGiven these provisions, while the State cannot discriminate against women in general public access or services, religious denominations have the constitutional right to manage their own religious affairs. This includes the administration of religious institutions, which may involve restrictions on entry based on religious doctrines or practices.\n\nTherefore, if a religious place restricts entry to women based on its religious management and practices, this falls within the rights granted to religious denominations under Article 26, subject to public order, morality, and health. Such restriction is not directly prohibited by the equality provisions, as these do not override the freedom to manage religious affairs.\n\nIn summary, the Constitution permits religious denominations to manage their own affairs, including entry restrictions based on religion or religious practices, even if such restrictions affect women. Hence, a religious place stopping a woman from entering on religious grounds is constitutionally permissible under the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs, as long as it does not violate public order, morality, or health.", "Every person is entitled to \"freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject to restrictions imposed by law in the interests of public order, morality, and health. This means that changing one's religion is protected under this freedom. The State cannot stop a person from changing their religion, as this right is fundamental. However, the State may regulate or restrict certain secular activities associated with religious practice or provide for social welfare and reform, but these do not negate the fundamental freedom to profess or change religion. Therefore, the government cannot prevent you from changing your religion, provided that your actions do not violate public order, morality, or health.", "If the police torture someone in custody, the right being violated is the \"Protection of life and personal liberty\" under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which states: \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\" Torture in custody infringes upon a person's personal liberty and life without due legal procedure.\n\nAdditionally, Article 22 provides protection against arrest and detention in certain cases, ensuring that \"No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" Torture would violate these protections as well.\n\nTherefore, torture by police in custody violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21 and 22, specifically the right to life and personal liberty and the protections against unlawful arrest and detention.", "If you are denied admission to a public university because you belong to a socially and educationally backward class, you have constitutional protections and remedies available.

Article 16(4) states that \"Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.\" By analogy, this principle extends to educational admissions, as the State can make provisions for reservation to ensure backward classes are not discriminated against.\n\n2.

Force is the cause that generates or changes motion, whereas quantity of motion is a measure of the motion itself, dependent on mass and velocity.\n\nIn summary, \"quantity of motion\" is a measure combining mass and velocity representing the motion of a body, while \"force\" is an impressed power that causes changes in motion or maintains the body's state of rest or uniform motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are stated as follows:\n\n1. **Law I:** \"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\" This means that a body will continue in its current state of motion or rest unless acted upon by an external force. For example, projectiles maintain their motion unless retarded by air resistance or pulled downward by gravity. Larger celestial bodies like planets and comets, encountering less resistance in space, preserve their motions\u2014both progressive and circular\u2014for much longer times.\n\n2. **Law II:** \"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\" In other words, the change in motion (momentum) of a body is proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of that force. If a force generates a certain motion, doubling the force doubles the motion, tripling the force triples the motion, whether the force is applied all at once or gradually. This motion, always directed the same way as the generating force, adds to or subtracts from the body's former motion depending on whether the forces conspire or oppose each other, or combine obliquely to produce a new compounded motion.\n\n3. **Law III:** \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\" This means that forces between two bodies are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, if you press a stone with your finger, the finger is pressed equally by the stone. If a horse pulls a stone tied to a rope, the horse is equally pulled back toward the stone by the tension in the rope, which opposes the horse's progress as much as it advances the stone.\n\n**Application in Celestial Mechanics:**\n\nNewton applied these laws to explain and unify the motions of celestial bodies. Using the principle of Universal Gravitation\u2014that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force inversely proportional to the square of their distance\u2014he deduced the motions of the moon and the planets, demonstrating the truth of Kepler's laws.\n\nThe laws govern the entire Solar System, explaining the movements of planets, satellites, and comets by showing how each body influences every other through reciprocal forces. The motions of bodies in orbit can be resolved into components directed toward the center (centripetal) and transverse to it, with the centripetal motions equal and the transverse motions related proportionally to angular motions of lines connecting the bodies. This framework accounts for the harmonious and diverse phenomena observed, from the swinging pendulum and ocean tides to the orbits of comets and the retrograding poles of the Earth.\n\nThus, Newton's three laws provide the fundamental mechanics by which celestial bodies move under mutual gravitational attraction, preserving their motions unless acted upon by external forces, changing their motions proportionally to the forces impressed, and interacting with equal and opposite forces between bodies.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law (that a line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times) by resolving the motion of a body moving in an orbit into two components according to \"Cor. 2 of the Laws of Motion\": one directed towards the center (centripetal) and the other transverse (perpendicular) to that line. He considers two bodies moving in similar orbits with very small intervals between points on their paths and shows that the increments or decrements of the distances from the center are always equal.\n\nBy resolving the motions at these points, the centripetal motions towards the center are equal, while the transverse motions are proportional to the angular motions of the radius lines. Because the centripetal force acts along the radius line and does not affect the transverse component of motion, the transverse velocity component remains such that the angular motion of the radius vector is uniform in a way that the area swept out by the radius vector in a given time remains constant.\n\nThus, the transverse motion of the body is proportional to the angular motion of the radius line, implying that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This follows from the fact that the force acting perpendicular to the path changes only the direction of motion, not the speed along the path, and the centripetal force acts along the radius line, ensuring the conservation of the areal velocity.\n\nIn summary, Newton uses his laws of motion to resolve the body's velocity into radial and transverse components, shows that the centripetal force affects only the radial component, and concludes that the transverse component (and thus the angular motion) is such that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times, thereby deriving Kepler's Second Law from his laws of motion and gravitation.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by starting from the motions of the planets and the moon, and applying the laws of Kepler. He infers from the second law of Kepler\u2014that every planet moves in an ellipse with the sun at one focus\u2014that the force retaining the planet in its orbit is always directed toward the sun and varies inversely as the square of the distance from that focus. He then mathematically demonstrates that a planet acted upon by such a force must move in a conic section (circular, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit).\n\nNewton further shows that this attracting or gravitating force resides in every particle of matter, but for spherical masses, it acts as if concentrated at their centers. Consequently, one spherical body acts upon another with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. He verifies this universal law by comparing the motions of terrestrial bodies, the moon, and other secondary orbs, ultimately generalizing it to explain the entire Solar System's movements\u2014planets, satellites, and comets alike.\n\nThus, Newton\u2019s method involves deducing the inverse-square law from the observed planetary motions and Kepler\u2019s laws, demonstrating the necessity of such a force for the observed orbital paths, and extending this principle universally to all matter, showing that gravitational attraction acts between all particles with a force inversely proportional to the square of their separation.", "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act universally on all masses is based on the observed proportionality of gravitational attraction to the quantity of matter in bodies and the mutual nature of this attraction. He reasons that since all bodies about the Earth gravitate towards it in proportion to their matter, and similarly the Moon gravitates towards the Earth, the sea towards the Moon, planets mutually towards one another, and comets towards the Sun, it follows that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. This universal gravitation is concluded with more force from appearances than other properties such as impenetrability, for which no celestial evidence exists.\n\nNewton further explains that the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises from the attractions towards its several parts. Considering a greater planet as formed of many lesser parts, the force of the whole must arise from the forces of the component parts. By the law that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, the mutual gravitation between bodies is reciprocal and proportional to their quantities of matter. The attraction of the Earth towards a particle on its surface is as the matter of the particle, and thus the attractive forces of all terrestrial bodies are as their quantities of matter. Since there is no difference of substance among bodies, only of modes and forms, these forces must be found universally in all bodies, celestial as well as terrestrial, and be proportional to their quantities of matter.\n\nNewton addresses the objection that if all bodies mutually gravitate, we should observe such gravitation everywhere. He answers that the gravitation towards smaller bodies is far less than towards the whole Earth and thus too small to be observed by our senses. Therefore, the universal law of gravitation is a grand generalization explaining the motions of all bodies in the Solar System\u2014planets, satellites, comets\u2014and harmonizing diverse phenomena by the ceaseless reciprocal influence of attraction between every particle and every other.\n\nIn summary, Newton's argument is that because gravitational attraction is proportional to matter, mutual, and observed universally among celestial bodies, and because the force of a whole arises from the sum of forces of its parts, it must be a universal principle acting on all masses without exception.", "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by analyzing the gravitational forces acting among the bodies in the system and their inequalities. He shows that the perturbation arises because the accelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest body (the sun) are not reciprocally as the squares of the distances from that body, especially when the inequality of this proportion is greater than the inequality of the distances themselves. When accelerative forces act unequally on different bodies, this causes perturbations in their motions and changes their relative situations.\n\nSpecifically, Newton quantifies the perturbations by comparing the gravitational forces between planets and the sun. For example, the force of gravity of Jupiter towards the sun is much greater than the perturbing force of Saturn on Jupiter, making Saturn's perturbation on Jupiter's orbit relatively small. However, the perturbation of Saturn's orbit due to Jupiter is more significant and noticeable, especially during conjunctions, because the gravitational influence of Jupiter on Saturn is not negligible. These mutual actions cause inequalities in the revolutions of the planets.\n\nNewton also notes that the common center of gravity of the Earth and Moon moves in an ellipse about the sun, and the Earth revolves about this center, causing a \"menstrual motion\" that perturbs Earth's orbit. Despite these perturbations, the aphelions and nodes of planetary orbits remain fixed, as the planes of the orbits are fixed, and any inequalities arising from mutual planetary actions are very small.\n\nFurthermore, Newton describes that forces acting in directions parallel to the line of nodes can introduce perturbations in latitude by attracting a planet out of the plane of its orbit, depending on the relative positions of the bodies involved.\n\nIn summary, Newton's method involves:\n\n1. Comparing gravitational forces between planets and the sun quantitatively to assess the magnitude of perturbations.\n\n2. Recognizing that unequal accelerative forces cause changes in the relative motions and positions of planets.\n\n3. Demonstrating that while perturbations exist due to mutual planetary attractions, the fundamental elements of orbits such as aphelions and nodes remain essentially fixed.\n\n4. Accounting for perturbations both in the plane of the orbit (longitude) and out of the plane (latitude), depending on the direction and magnitude of the forces.\n\nThis approach explains the perturbation of planetary orbits as arising from the unequal gravitational attractions among planets and the sun, causing small but measurable deviations in their motions.", "Newton employed mathematical tools that were precursors to calculus in his Principia, notably his method of fluxions and infinite series. Building on the work of predecessors such as Wallis, he invented the celebrated BINOMIAL THEOREM, which he applied to the rectification of curves, determination of surfaces and solids, and the position of their centres of gravity. He discovered the general principle of deducing the areas of curves from the ordinate by considering the area as a nascent quantity increasing by continual fluxion in proportion to the length of the ordinate, with the abscissa increasing uniformly in proportion to time. He regarded lines as generated by the motion of points, surfaces by the motion of lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces. From the equation of a curve, he deduced the velocities with which these quantities are generated and obtained the ultimate value required by the rules of infinite series. To the velocities with which every line or quantity is generated, he gave the name of \"FLUXIONS,\" and to the lines or quantities themselves, that of \"FLUENTS.\"\n\nNewton's method of fluxions was essentially the same as the differential method except for the name and mode of notation. While Leibnitz called these quantities \"differences\" and marked them with the letter d, Newton called them \"moments\" or \"fluxions\" and did not use the letter d. This difference in notation explains why Newton did not use the standard calculus notation familiar today. His approach was grounded in geometric and kinematic reasoning, viewing quantities as generated by motion and fluxions as their velocities of generation, rather than employing the symbolic differential notation introduced by Leibnitz.\n\nThus, Newton's Principia used the method of fluxions and infinite series as mathematical tools that anticipated calculus, but he did not adopt the standard calculus notation because his method was framed in terms of fluxions and fluents with a distinct symbolic system and conceptual framework differing from Leibnitz's differential notation.", "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining it as a force directed towards a center that restrains a body from flying off in a straight line and keeps it revolving in an orbit. He illustrates this with the example of a stone whirled in a sling: the stone tends to fly away tangentially due to its velocity, but the sling exerts a force directed toward the hand (the center), which continually draws the stone back and retains it in its orbit. This force opposing the stone\u2019s natural tendency to recede is called the \"centripetal force.\"\n\nNewton generalizes this concept to all bodies revolving in orbits, stating that they all endeavor to recede from the centers of their orbits, but the opposition of a contrary force\u2014centripetal force\u2014restrains and detains them in their orbits. Without this force, bodies would move off in straight lines with uniform motion.\n\nHe further explains that by tracing the quantity and properties of this centripetal force from observed phenomena, one can apply these principles mathematically to estimate effects in more complex cases. Newton avoids hypothesizing about the nature or quality of this force, instead calling it by the general name \"centripetal force\" because it is directed toward some center, such as circumsolar or circumterrestrial, depending on the central body involved.\n\nNewton also shows that the centripetal force varies with distance in a specific manner. For example, in elliptical orbits where the force is reciprocally as the square of the distance (altitude), the centripetal force decreases nearly as the duplicate of the distance squared. He demonstrates that if a body is urged by such a centripetal force, it will revolve in an ellipse with the focus at the center of force. If additional forces act, the motion of the orbit\u2019s apsides can be determined accordingly.\n\nIn summary, Newton explains orbital motion by positing that a centripetal force, directed toward the center of the orbit, continuously acts on a body to counter its natural tendency to move in a straight line, thereby retaining it in a curved path. This force\u2019s magnitude and variation with distance can be mathematically derived from observed orbital phenomena, allowing the prediction and understanding of planetary and projectile motions.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the nature and magnitude of the resistance encountered by bodies moving through these media. He establishes that:\n\n1. The resistance a body meets in a fluid medium arises partly from the density of the medium, partly from its tenacity, and partly from attrition. The part of the resistance due to the density of the fluid is \"in a duplicate ratio of the velocity\" (i.e., proportional to the square of the velocity), while the part arising from the tenacity of the fluid is uniform or proportional to the time elapsed (the moment of time).\n\n2. In a medium whose parts do not mutually act with any force at a distance (i.e., a medium without internal forces among its particles), the resistance to a moving body is \"in the duplicate ratio of the velocity accurately.\" This means that the resistance increases as the square of the velocity.\n\n3. For elastic fluids like air, where the particles are at rest among themselves and mutually act with accelerative forces proportional to the diameters of the bodies inversely and the squares of their velocities directly, a projected body moving swiftly meets resistance nearly proportional to the square of its velocity.\n\n4. The resistance arises from the \"inactivity of the matter,\" which is essential and always proportional to the quantity of matter. The pressure from the motion of the body is spent in generating motion in the parts of the fluid, creating resistance.\n\n5. Newton also notes that in slow motions, resistance may be slightly less due to the shape of the body (e.g., a globe is more adapted to motion than a cylinder of the same diameter), and in swift motions, resistance may be slightly greater because the elasticity and compression of the fluid do not increase exactly in the duplicate ratio of velocity. However, these nuances are considered minor and are not further accounted for.\n\n6. The density of the medium relative to the density of the moving body affects the resistance: if the density of the cylinder (body) is increased or decreased, its motion and the force by which its motion may be generated or destroyed in the same time vary in the same ratio. The resistance of any cylinder is nearly as the density of the medium to the density of the cylinder.\n\n7. A fluid must be compressed to become continuous and non-elastic so that pressure arising from compression propagates instantly and acts equally on all parts of the body moved, producing no change in resistance. The resistance is thus due to the fluid's inertia and the motion imparted to its parts.\n\nIn summary, Newton models resistance in resisting media as composed of a part proportional to the square of the velocity (arising from the fluid's density and inertia) and a part uniform in time (arising from the fluid's tenacity), with the dominant resistance for swift motion being nearly proportional to the square of the velocity. The resistance results from the fluid's inertia and the motion it is forced to take by the moving body, and the ratio of densities between medium and body influences the magnitude of resistance.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs fundamentally from relative motion in that absolute space \"in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable,\" whereas relative space is \"some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces,\" determined by its position relative to bodies and commonly mistaken for immovable space. Absolute time \"flows equably without regard to anything external,\" serving as a true and mathematical measure of duration, while relative time is an apparent, sensible measure based on motion, such as hours or days.\n\nAbsolute motion is defined as \"the translation of a body from one absolute place into another,\" whereas relative motion is \"the translation from one relative place into another.\" Relative motion depends on the positions of bodies relative to one another and can be changed without any force acting on the body itself, for example, by moving the bodies with which it is compared. In contrast, true or absolute motion is always generated or altered only by some force impressed upon the body moved. True motion \"does by no means consist in such relations\" as relative motion does.\n\nBecause absolute space is immovable and absolute time flows uniformly, absolute rest and motion can be distinguished from relative rest and motion. For instance, a body relatively at rest within a moving ship partakes of the ship's motion relative to absolute space. Absolute motions are composed of the motion of the body out of its first place plus the motion of that place out of its place, continuing until reaching an immovable place in absolute space.\n\nThis framework supports Newton's laws by providing a fixed, immovable reference\u2014absolute space and time\u2014against which true motions and forces can be measured and distinguished from mere relative motions. Forces impressed upon bodies generate true motion, which is necessary for the application and understanding of Newton's laws, since relative motion alone may change without any force acting on the body. Thus, Newton's laws rely on the concepts of absolute space and time to define true motion and rest, ensuring that forces and motions are not confused with mere changes in relative position.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. Beyond him, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot with certainty be traced.", "Beyond Sir Isaac Newton's grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot with certainty be traced. Two family traditions existed: one claiming Scotch extraction, and the other asserting origin from Newton in Lancashire, with a period of residence at Westby, county of Lincoln, before moving to and purchasing Woolsthorpe about a hundred years prior to Isaac Newton's birth. Thus, no other definite ancestors or descent lines apart from his grandfather are known with certainty."]}

The walker and lumbar belt post-discharge are not payable under this policy unless the lumbar belt is related to lumbar spine surgery, which is not the case here.", "For an insured's child who is a dependent above 18 but under 26 years old, unemployed and unmarried, requiring dental surgery after an accident, the claim admissibility and process are as follows:\n\n**Eligibility and Coverage Conditions:**\n\n1. **Dependent Eligibility:** The insured's child qualifies as a dependent if above 18 and under 26 years of age, unmarried and unemployed, as implied by the context of dependent children claims.\n\n2. **Dental Surgery Coverage:** Dental treatment, dentures, or surgery of any kind are excluded unless:\n   - The treatment is necessitated due to an accident, and\n   - It requires a minimum of 24 hours hospitalization.\n   - Treatment related to gum or tooth disease or damage is excluded unless it involves irreversible bone disease of the jaw that cannot be treated otherwise.\n\n3. **Medical Necessity:** The surgery must be upon the advice of a doctor and supported by clinical protocols.\n\n4. **Exclusions:** Cosmetic or plastic surgery is excluded unless it is reconstruction following an accident or medically necessary to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.\n\n**Claim Process:**\n\n1. **Claim Submission:** The insured person must submit a claim form along with:\n   - Invoices,\n   - Treating medical practitioner's prescription,\n   - Medical reports,\n   - All documents must be duly signed by the insured person.\n\n2. **Documentation Required (especially for accidental cases):**\n   - Medical history and diagnosis details,\n   - Investigation test reports,\n   - Prescription from the attending medical practitioner,\n   - Hospital discharge certificate/summary,\n   - Photo ID and age proof,\n   - Policy copy and health card,\n   - Original hospital bills with detailed breakup and payment receipts,\n   - Original invoices and payment receipts for any implants used,\n   - All diagnostic reports with prescriptions and bills,\n   - Medicine/pharmacy bills with prescriptions,\n   - Medico-legal case (MLC) or FIR copy (mandatory in accidental cases),\n   - Pre and post-operative imaging reports.\n\n3. **Medical Examination:** The insured person must submit to medical examination by the insurer\u2019s medical practitioner or authorized representative if requested.\n\n4. **Assessment and Settlement:** The insurer will assess the claim documents to ascertain admissibility and settle or reject the claim within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.\n\n5. **Treatment Compliance:** Treatment must be taken as per the directions and advice of the treating medical practitioner; failure to comply may prejudice the claim.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The child's dental surgery claim after an accident is admissible only if the surgery requires at least 24 hours hospitalization and is medically necessary due to the accident.\n- Cosmetic dental procedures or routine dental treatments are excluded.\n- The claim must be supported by comprehensive medical documentation, including an MLC/FIR copy due to the accidental nature.\n- The insured must follow the prescribed claim procedure, including submitting all required documents and allowing medical examination if requested.\n- The insurer will process and settle the claim within 15 days after receiving all necessary documents.\n\nThis ensures that the claim is evaluated strictly on eligibility, medical necessity, and compliance with procedural requirements.", "If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, the expenses for IONM are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. This is explicitly stated under the Modern Treatment Methods & Advancement in Technology section, where IONM is listed among treatments covered up to the policy-specified limit.\n\nRegarding ICU care expenses in a city with a population over 1 million, ICU Charges include the amount charged by the hospital for ICU bed, general medical support services including monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The policy covers ICU accommodation charges up to the category or limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. Room rent for ICU is limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI), inclusive of nursing charges. If the insured is admitted to a higher room category than covered, the insured bears the difference proportionally.\n\nAdditionally, 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI guidelines, which would include IONM, are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured. Cyber-knife, Gamma knife, and cochlear implant treatments are also restricted to 50% of the SI, indicating a similar approach to limiting advanced treatment expenses.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- IONM expenses during brain surgery are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, subject to a 50% of Sum Insured cap applicable to modern treatments.\n\n- ICU care expenses in a city over 1 million population are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, with ICU room rent limited to 4% of the Sum Insured inclusive of nursing charges.

The insurer will include the child as an Insured Person only if the application for cover is accepted, the additional premium on a pro-rata basis for the risk coverage duration is received, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. This process applies similarly to additions of dependents under the Employer\u2013Employee Group or as specified in the Policy Schedule for Non-Employer\u2013Employee Groups.\n\nRegarding eligibility, dependent children covered under the policy must be between 91 days and 18 years of age, provided either or both parents are covered concurrently. Since the child is 3 years old, they meet the age eligibility criterion. Children above 18 years may continue coverage up to age 26 if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.\n\nThe insurer may refuse coverage or terminate the child's cover under the following circumstances:\n- If the policyholder does not pay the premiums owed within the grace period.\n- If the dependent ceases to be a dependent as defined by the policy.\n- If the policyholder or insured member ceases to be a member of the group.\n- Upon termination of the policy itself.\n\nAdditionally, any endorsement request, including adding dependents, must be made in writing by the policyholder and will be effective from the date the request or premium receipt is acknowledged, whichever is later.\n\nIn summary, the policyholder must notify the insurer in writing to add the adopted child, pay the applicable pro-rata premium, and obtain an endorsement.

The insured must produce the TPA-issued ID card at admission, complete the cashless request form, and the TPA will issue pre-authorization valid for 15 days.\n\n   - If the procedure is in a non-network hospital, payment must be made upfront by the insured person.\n\n3. **Claim Process for the Subsequent Inpatient Care in a Non-Network Hospital:**\n\n   - Payment must be made upfront by the insured person.\n\n   - For reimbursement, the insured must submit the necessary original claim documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limits.\n\n4. **Document Submission and Time Limits:**\n\n   - For reimbursement of hospitalisation and day care expenses, submit the claim documents within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.\n\n   - For post-hospitalisation expenses, submit documents within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.\n\n   - The claim must be supported by original documents including:\n\n     - Duly completed claim form.\n\n     - Photo ID and age proof.\n\n     - Health card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n\n     - Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis and nature of operation performed, with date of diagnosis and investigation reports.\n\n     - Cash receipts and bills in the insured person's name.\n\n     - For inpatient care, copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheets detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.\n\n5. **Additional Notes:**\n\n   - Pre-authorization request is not a denial of treatment or coverage; treatment can proceed as per doctor's advice, and claim documents can be submitted for reimbursement.\n\n   - Claims for pre- and post-hospitalisation expenses are settled on a reimbursement basis upon production of relevant claim papers and cash receipts.\n\n   - The insurer will assess the claim documents and settle or reject the claim within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.\n\nIn summary, the insured must notify the TPA timely according to the nature of hospitalisation (planned or emergency), pay upfront for treatment in non-network hospitals, and submit all required original documents within 15 days of discharge or completion of treatment for reimbursement. The claim for the day care procedure and the subsequent inpatient care are processed separately but follow the same notification and documentation requirements.", "If an insured mother with maternity cover is admitted for a complicated C-section, the maternity benefit covers expenses up to INR 50,000 for the C-section, applicable for the first two children only. The newborn baby is covered from Day 1 within the Family Sum Insured, provided that the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted, and acceptance of the newborn as an insured person requires written notification on or before the last day of the month following the birth and receipt of the agreed premium.\n\nRegarding the newborn's treatment expenses, including intensive care, coverage applies from birth if the newborn is accepted as an insured person under the policy terms. However, this acceptance is conditional on timely notification and premium payment. The policy requires the insured to take all reasonable steps to safeguard against illnesses or injuries that may give rise to claims.\n\nIf the newborn expires within 24 hours, the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses depends on whether the newborn was accepted as an insured person by fulfilling the notification and premium payment conditions. Only then will the newborn's treatment expenses, including intensive care, be payable under the Family Sum Insured.\n\nExclusions and waiting periods apply individually to each insured person, including the newborn. The policy does not explicitly state exclusions specific to newborn intensive care, but general exclusions such as certain chronic diseases and psychiatric disorders apply. The maternity benefit includes pre- and post-natal expenses up to Rs 5,000 within the maternity limit on an inpatient basis.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Maternity benefit covers up to INR 50,000 for C-section for first two children.\n- Newborn is covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured if accepted as insured by written notification and premium payment on or before the last day of the month following birth.\n- Newborn treatment expenses, including intensive care, are payable only if the newborn is accepted as insured.\n- Reasonable care must be taken by the insured to prevent illness or injury.\n- Waiting periods and exclusions apply individually.\n- Pre- and post-natal expenses up to Rs 5,000 are covered within maternity limit.\n- If the newborn dies within 24 hours, claim eligibility for treatment expenses depends on newborn\u2019s acceptance as insured and fulfillment of policy conditions.\n\nNo explicit clause in the provided text states automatic coverage of newborn intensive care expenses if the newborn expires within 24 hours without fulfilling the notification and premium conditions. Therefore, claim eligibility for the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses hinges on compliance with these terms.", "A claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment supported by a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is not sufficient according to the policy requirements.\n\nJustification:\n\n1. **Eligible Mental Health Professionals:**  \n   \"Mental Healthcare Professional\" is defined as:  \n   (i) a psychiatrist,  \n   (ii) a professional registered with the concerned State Authority, or  \n   (iii) a professional having a post-graduate degree in Ayurveda (Mano Vigyan Avum Manas Roga), Homoeopathy (Psychiatry), Unani (Moalijat Nafasiyatt), Siddha (Sirappu Maruthuvam), or  \n   (iv) a Clinical Psychologist.  \n   However, a \"Psychiatrist\" specifically means a medical practitioner possessing a post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry recognized by the University Grants Commission, National Board of Examinations, or Medical Council of India, or declared by the State Government as a psychiatrist.  \n\n   Thus, a Clinical Psychologist is recognized as a Mental Healthcare Professional, but a general practitioner is not listed as an eligible mental health professional.\n\n2. **Claim Document Requirements:**  \n   For inpatient claims, the policy requires:  \n   - Prescription from the attending medical practitioner (which implies a qualified medical practitioner such as a psychiatrist, not a general practitioner without psychiatric qualifications).  \n   - Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.  \n   - Medical history, bills, and payment receipts supported by prescription from attending medical practitioner/hospital.  \n   - All original diagnostic reports with medical practitioner's prescription.  \n   - Original medicine/pharmacy bills with medical practitioner's prescription.  \n\n   The discharge summary must be from the hospital, not just certified by a Clinical Psychologist. The prescription must be from the attending medical practitioner, which in the context of psychiatric inpatient treatment would be a psychiatrist or other eligible mental health professional as defined.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since the prescription is from a general practitioner (not an eligible mental health professional) and the discharge summary is certified by a Clinical Psychologist but not issued by the hospital, the submitted documents do not meet the policy's claim document requirements for inpatient psychiatric treatment. The prescription must be from the attending medical practitioner (psychiatrist or other eligible mental health professional), and the discharge summary must be from the hospital.\n\nTherefore, the claim submission with only a general practitioner's prescription and a discharge summary certified by a Clinical Psychologist is insufficient for claim settlement under the policy.", "For a patient receiving oral chemotherapy in a network hospital who requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session, the admissibility and constraints are as follows:\n\n1. **ECG Electrodes:**  \n   - Up to 5 electrodes are required for every case visiting the Operation Theatre (OT) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  \n   - For longer stays in ICU, a change of electrodes is required, and at least one set every second day is payable.\n\n2. **Gloves:**  \n   - Only sterilized gloves are payable.  \n   - Unsterilized gloves are not payable.\n\nThese items are reimbursable as per the annexures specifying consumables related to treatment. The reimbursement is subject to the stated limits on quantity and type (sterilized only for gloves). There is no indication that these items are subsumed under room charges or excluded elsewhere.\n\nNo additional constraints specific to oral chemotherapy sessions are mentioned beyond these conditions. Oral chemotherapy itself is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period.\n\nTherefore, ECG electrodes and sterilized gloves used during oral chemotherapy sessions in a network hospital are admissible for reimbursement, with the constraints that ECG electrodes are limited to 5 per session or one set every second day for ICU stays, and only sterilized gloves are payable.", "The expenses that can be claimed under the policy for the insured person who was hospitalized and developed an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge, as well as pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission, are as follows:\n\n1. **Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:**\n   - These expenses are covered if they are \"incurred due to an Illness or Injury that occurs during the Policy Period\" and are related to the same Illness or Injury for which hospitalization was claimed.\n   - Coverage is limited to the number of days and amount specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, or the actual expenses incurred, whichever is less.\n   - The date of admission to the hospital for this benefit is considered the date of the insured person's first admission for the same illness.\n   - Since the pre-hospitalisation expenses occurred 18 days before admission, they fall within the typical pre-hospitalisation period (usually defined by the policy schedule limits) and can be claimed if within the specified number of days and amount limits.\n\n2. **Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses:**\n   - These expenses are covered on a reimbursement basis for medical expenses incurred following an Illness or Injury that occurs during the Policy Period, up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.\n   - Coverage applies only if an in-patient hospitalisation claim has been accepted for the same illness.\n   - The post-hospitalisation expenses must be related to the same illness or injury.\n   - The date of discharge for this benefit is the insured person's last discharge from the hospital for the same illness.\n   - Since the infection requiring diagnostics and pharmacy expenses arose 20 days after discharge, these post-hospitalisation expenses can be claimed if they fall within the number of days and amount limits specified in the policy schedule.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission can be claimed if they are related to the same illness and within the policy's specified pre-hospitalisation period and amount limits.\n- The post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge can be claimed if they are related to the same illness, the in-patient hospitalisation claim has been accepted, and they fall within the policy's specified post-hospitalisation period and amount limits.\n\nAll claims under these benefits must follow the claim process defined under Clause VI.4.", "If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, their coverage continues only until the point they cease to be a Dependent, which generally means coverage ends when the dependent no longer meets the eligibility criteria such as age limit. Specifically, children above 18 years continue to be covered up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Upon turning 27, the dependent ceases to be eligible unless otherwise specifically agreed for continuation till the end of the policy period.\n\nCoverage termination for a dependent occurs immediately when they cease to be a Dependent, unless there is a specific agreement for continuation until the end of the policy period. The policy states that cover will end for a dependent \"when a dependent insured person ceases to be a Dependent; unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period.\" If no such agreement exists, coverage ends at that point.\n\nRegarding deletion protocols, the policyholder must notify the insurer of all changes in membership, including dependents ceasing eligibility, on or before the last day of the succeeding month. Deletion of dependents is effective from the date they cease eligibility or as specified in the Policy Schedule. Refunds of premium, if any, are made on a pro-rata basis provided no claims are outstanding or paid for that insured person or dependent.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Coverage for a dependent child turning 27 ends when they cease to be a Dependent (i.e., after age 26), unless there is a specific agreement to continue coverage until the end of the policy period.\n\n- If no such agreement exists, coverage terminates immediately upon loss of dependent status.\n\n- The policyholder must notify the insurer of such changes timely for deletion.\n\n- Premium refunds, if applicable, are on a pro-rata basis and only if no claims are outstanding.\n\n- Coverage is valid for the policy period as specified, but dependent eligibility is governed by age and other criteria; turning 27 generally ends dependent coverage unless otherwise agreed.\n\nTherefore, even if the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, coverage for the dependent child who turns 27 during the policy period will terminate immediately upon loss of dependent status unless a specific agreement for continuation till the end of the policy period exists.", "When the insured opts for a single private room that costs more than the allowed room rent limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, the reimbursement of all associated medical expenses incurred at the hospital\u2014including diagnostic and specialist fees billed separately\u2014is subject to the \"Proportionate Clause.\" This clause states that the reimbursement/payment of these associated medical expenses shall be effected \"in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.\" In other words, the insurer will pay only a proportionate amount of the diagnostic and specialist fees relative to the ratio of the policy's room rent limit to the actual room rent charged.\n\nHowever, proportionate deductions will not be applied in cases where the hospital does not follow differential billing or for expenses where differential billing is not adopted based on the room category.\n\nThis is detailed under the clause referred to as the \"Proportionate Clause\" found in the policy provisions related to room rent limits and associated expenses reimbursement.", "If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the following course of action applies:\n\n1. **Deficiency Intimation and Resubmission:**  \n   When there is a deficiency in necessary claim documents, the insurer (TPA/Company) will intimate the insured person of such deficiency. The insured has 10 working days from the first intimation to meet or partially meet the deficiency by submitting the required documents. Up to three reminders may be sent. If the deficiency is not met or only partially met within this period, the insurer may, at its sole discretion, deduct the amount of claim related to the deficiency and settle the claim if it is otherwise valid under the policy.\n\n2. **Claim Settlement or Rejection Timeline:**  \n   Upon receipt of the last necessary document, the insurer shall settle or reject the claim, including any partial rejection, within 15 days.\n\n3. **If Documents Are Resubmitted After 10 Days:**  \n   The text does not explicitly state the procedure if documents are resubmitted after the 10 working days deadline. However, since the insurer settles or rejects claims within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document, it implies that upon receiving the documents even after 10 days, the insurer will reassess and communicate the decision within 15 days.\n\n4. **Contesting a Final Rejection:**  \n   If the insurer decides to reject the claim, it will communicate the rejection in writing, explicitly stating the grounds for rejection, within 15 days from receipt of the final documents or investigation report. The insured person may, within 15 days from the date of receipt of the rejection decision, represent to the insurer for reconsideration of the decision.\n\n5. **Communication and Grievance Procedure:**  \n   All communications related to the policy, including claim decisions and grievances, must be made in writing to the company\u2019s specified address or electronic contact as per the policy schedule. No agents or brokers are authorized to receive notices unless explicitly stated in writing by the insurer. Disputes or differences regarding interpretation of policy terms or claim decisions are subject to Indian courts and law.\n\nIn summary, if a claim is partly rejected due to missing documents and the insured submits the documents after 10 days, the insurer will reassess and communicate a final decision within 15 days of receiving those documents. If the final decision is rejection, the insured has 15 days from receipt of that decision to contest it by representing to the insurer for reconsideration, following which further grievance procedures may be pursued as per the policy\u2019s communication and jurisdiction rules.", "The claim for hospitalization of an insured person for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia is eligible under the policy's definition of hospitalization for specified procedures. Hospitalisation is defined as \"admission in a Hospital for a minimum period of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours except for specified procedures/treatments, where such admission could be for a period of less than 24 consecutive hours\" (Chunk 43). This exception applies when technological advances have reduced the required hospitalization time for certain procedures that previously required more than 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, if the minimally invasive surgery is one of the specified procedures recognized by the insurer as eligible for less than 24 hours of hospitalization due to technological advances, the claim is admissible despite the hospitalization being only 22 hours.\n\nThe relevant category is the definition of \"Hospitalisation\" under Clause 17 (Chunk 43), which states the minimum 24-hour inpatient care requirement except for specified procedures/treatments where shorter admissions are allowed.\n\nNo further specific list of minimally invasive surgeries or their hospitalization requirements is provided in the text, but the principle that hospitalization less than 24 hours is acceptable for specified procedures due to technological advances is clearly established.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Hospitalisation means admission for a minimum of 24 consecutive hours except for specified procedures/treatments.\n\n- For such specified procedures (including minimally invasive surgeries under general anesthesia that previously required over 24 hours), hospitalization less than 24 hours is acceptable.\n\n- Hence, the insured's claim for 22 hours hospitalization for minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia is eligible under this exception.\n\nThis is based on the policy's hospitalization definition and its allowance for shorter admissions for specified procedures due to technological advances (Chunk 43).", "When the insured is hospitalized in a town with a population of less than 1,000,000, the hospital must meet the following minimum infrastructure requirements to qualify under this policy:\n\n- Employ qualified nursing staff round the clock.\n- Have at least 10 in-patient beds.\n- Have qualified medical practitioner(s) in charge round the clock.\n- Have a fully equipped operation theatre of its own where surgical procedures are carried out.\n- Maintain daily records of patients and make them accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.\n\nIn metropolitan areas or towns with a population of 1,000,000 or more, the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, while all other requirements remain the same.\n\nThus, the key difference in infrastructure requirements between towns with less than 1 million population and metropolitan areas is the minimum number of in-patient beds: 10 beds in smaller towns versus 15 beds in metropolitan areas. All other criteria\u2014qualified nursing staff and medical practitioners round the clock, fully equipped operation theatre, and maintenance of daily patient records accessible to the insurer\u2014are consistent across both settings.", "A group employer wishing to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy must adhere to the following eligibility criteria and documentation procedures:\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\n\n1. **New Employee:**\n   - A newly appointed employee can be added as an Insured Person during the Policy period.\n   - The employee must be part of the group covered under the policy, which requires a minimum group size of seven employees/members.\n\n2. **Spouse of Employee:**\n   - The employee\u2019s legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner) may be covered.\n   - The life partner must be declared at the time of inception of the Policy; no change is accepted during the Policy period except at renewal.\n   - Newly wedded spouses can be added mid-policy.\n\n3. **Sibling of Employee:**\n   - The employee\u2019s siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 years.\n   - They must be unmarried, unemployed, and dependent on the employee.\n\n**Addition Procedure and Documentation:**\n\n- The Policyholder (employer) must submit a written application for cover for each new insured person (employee, spouse, sibling).\n- The application must be accepted by the insurer.\n- Additional premium on a pro-rata basis, calculated for the risk coverage duration of the new insured person, must be paid.\n- The insurer will issue an endorsement confirming the addition of the new insured persons.\n- The Policyholder must provide all written information reasonably required to calculate premium and process claims, including the complete list of members at policy issuance, renewal, and periodic updates on entries and exits.\n- Any request for endorsement (addition) must be made in writing by the Policyholder.\n- The Policyholder may issue confirmation of insurance protection to individual employees referencing the Group Insurance policy and benefits.\n- Claims of individual employees may be processed through the employer.\n\nNo specific documentation checklist is detailed in the text, but the emphasis is on written information reasonably required by the insurer and formal written requests by the Policyholder.\n\nIn summary, the new employee, their spouse (legal or life partner declared at inception or newly wedded), and sibling (unmarried, unemployed, dependent, and under 26 years) can be added mid-policy by submitting a written application, paying pro-rata premium, and receiving insurer endorsement, with the employer responsible for providing all necessary information and formal requests.", "Robotic surgeries, including robotic-assisted surgeries for cancer (malignancies), are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period.

Such denial does not imply denial of treatment or coverage.\n   - Cashless facility for hospitalization expenses is limited to medical expenses incurred in a network provider hospital for covered illness, injury, or accident. The insured must settle non-admissible expenses, expenses above sub-limits, co-payments, and deductibles directly with the hospital.\n\n2. **Documentation Requirements:**\n   - Prescription from the attending medical practitioner specifying the nature of operation performed and date of diagnosis.\n   - Investigation test reports supported by the prescription.\n   - Medical history including all previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for the current ailment.\n   - Bills with detailed breakup of charges and payment receipts supported by prescriptions.\n   - Discharge certificate or summary from the hospital.\n   - Photo ID and age proof.\n   - Health card, policy copy, photo ID, and KYC documents.\n   - Original final hospital bill with detailed breakup, including all original deposit and final payment receipts.\n   - Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries.\n   - All original diagnostic reports (imaging and laboratory) with medical practitioner\u2019s prescription and invoice/bill with receipt.\n   - All original medicine/pharmacy bills with medical practitioner\u2019s prescription.\n   - MLC (Medico-Legal Case) or FIR copy in accidental cases.\n   - Pre and post-operative imaging reports.\n   - Air ambulance ticket from the registered service provider.\n\n3. **Claims Assessment:**\n   - Claims will be processed after verification from the network provider regarding utilization of pre-authorization and settlement of dues by the insured.\n   - Pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses claims are processed only after the main hospitalization claim decision.\n   - Claims are assessed in the following order:\n     1.

Comprehensive documentation including prescriptions, medical history, bills, diagnostic reports, discharge summary, and legal documents (MLC/FIR) must be submitted. Claims are assessed systematically considering proportionate clauses, co-pay, limits, and deductibles, with payments made directly to network providers after verification. The insured is responsible for settling non-admissible and additional expenses directly with the hospital.", "If an insured person who had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer ports their policy to this insurer, the waiting periods for specific illnesses, such as knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis, will be treated with accrued continuity benefits as per IRDAI guidelines on portability. Specifically:\n\n- The insured will receive a reduction in the waiting period to the extent of the prior continuous coverage without any lapses under any health insurance policy with an Indian General/Health Insurer.\n\n- For knee replacement surgery (other than caused by an accident) and related conditions like osteoarthritis, which are listed under specific diseases/procedures subject to waiting periods, the waiting period exclusion applies from the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer. However, if the insured has continuous coverage without any break as defined under IRDAI portability norms, the waiting period for these listed conditions will be reduced by the duration of prior coverage.\n\n- If there is an enhancement of the sum insured, the waiting period exclusion applies afresh to the increased sum insured.\n\n- The policy explicitly states that the waiting period for listed conditions applies even if the condition is contracted after the policy commencement or declared and accepted without a specific exclusion, but continuous coverage allows for reduction of the waiting period.\n\n- The policy is ordinarily renewable and renewal shall not be denied on grounds of prior claims, supporting continuity.\n\n- After completion of sixty continuous months of coverage (including portability and migration), no policy or claim shall be contestable on grounds of non-disclosure or misrepresentation except fraud, indicating a moratorium period that further supports continuity benefits.\n\nIn summary, for knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis, if the insured ported the policy with continuous prior coverage and no lapses, the waiting period will be reduced by the length of prior coverage as per IRDAI portability guidelines, ensuring accrued continuity benefits in waiting periods are honored.", "If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, the expense will generally not be covered if the medication or treatment is considered \"unproven\" or \"experimental.\" \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment\" is defined as treatment, including drug experimental therapy, which is not based on established medical practice in India and is therefore experimental or unproven (Clause 43).\n\nFurthermore, any treatment or part of a treatment that is not a \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" will not be covered. \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" excludes drugs or treatments which are not supported by a prescription, or treatments that are not of a reasonable charge (Clause 84, point 7). Coverage requires that the treatment be medically necessary and supported by a prescription from a qualified medical practitioner.\n\nFor claim reimbursement, the insured must submit supporting documents including the prescription from the attending medical practitioner, medical history, hospital discharge summary, original medicine/pharmacy bills along with the medical practitioner's prescription, and other relevant medical records (Clause 120). The medical necessity of the treatment must be certified by the treating specialist (Clause 132).\n\nPre-authorization of treatment is recommended but not mandatory; the insured may proceed with treatment as per the doctor's advice and submit claim documents for possible reimbursement. However, claims will be assessed for admissibility based on medical necessity and policy terms (Clause 119).\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Imported medications not normally used in India may be considered unproven or experimental if not based on established medical practice in India, and such treatments are excluded from coverage.\n\n- Only medically necessary treatments supported by prescriptions are covered.\n\n- Claims require detailed documentation proving medical necessity and prescription support.\n\n- Pre-authorization is advisable but not a prerequisite for claim submission.\n\nTherefore, unless the imported medication is recognized as medically necessary and not classified as unproven or experimental, the expense will not be covered under the policy.", "If a member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period, the coverage for their dependents may continue until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. Specifically, in the event of the death of an employee (or member), his/her dependents may continue to be covered until the policy period expires, provided the insured opts for this continuation.\n\nCoverage for the deceased member themselves ends immediately upon death. Dependents' coverage also ends if a dependent ceases to be a dependent unless there is a specific agreement for continuation until the end of the policy period.\n\nThus, the option for continued coverage of dependents after the member's death exists until the policy's expiration, contingent on the insured's choice. No further coverage or services are provided beyond the policy termination date, and treatment costs incurred after termination are not payable unless treatment commenced before termination.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Upon death of the member, their coverage ends immediately.\n\n- Dependents may continue coverage until the policy expires, at the insured's option.\n\n- Coverage ends for dependents if they cease to be dependents unless continuation is specifically agreed.\n\n- No coverage or claims are payable after policy termination.\n\nThis continuation option and conditions are as specified in the Policy Schedule for non-employer group policies.", "For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the requirement for supporting documentation includes submitting the original invoice along with the implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries. Specifically, the claim must be supported by the \"original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers\" corresponding to the implanted device (e.g., stent invoice and sticker in angioplasty surgery).\n\nIf only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, this constitutes a deficiency in the necessary claim documents. The Third Party Administrator (TPA) or the insurance company will scrutinize the claim form and accompanying documents and notify the insured of any deficiencies. If the deficiency\u2014such as missing implant stickers\u2014is not rectified within 10 working days of the first intimation, after up to three reminders, the company may, at its sole discretion, decide to deduct the amount related to the deficient documentation from the claim settlement or potentially deny that portion of the claim, even if the rest of the claim is otherwise valid under the policy.\n\nThus, the implant sticker is a critical piece of documentation for implant-related claims, and failure to provide it may lead to partial deduction or non-settlement of the claim amount related to the implant.", "Home nursing charges incurred after discharge qualify for reimbursement under the Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. An In-patient Hospitalisation claim has been accepted under the policy clauses III.A.1 or III.A.2 for the same illness or injury.\n2. The post-hospitalisation medical expenses, including home nursing charges, are related to the same illness or injury for which the hospitalisation claim was accepted.\n3. The post-hospitalisation expenses are incurred within the number of days and up to the amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.\n4. The date of discharge for this benefit is considered the last discharge date from the hospital related to the same illness or injury for which the inpatient claim was accepted.\n\nAdditionally, special nursing charges, including private nurse charges, are payable in the post-hospitalisation period.\n\nFor domiciliary hospitalisation (home treatment when hospitalisation is not possible), medical expenses including home nursing charges are covered if:\n\n1. The domiciliary hospitalisation continues for at least 3 consecutive days.\n2. The treating Medical Practitioner confirms in writing that domiciliary hospitalisation was medically required and that the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or that a hospital bed was unavailable.\n3. The condition treated is not among the excluded ailments such as asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, psychiatric disorders, and others listed.\n\nAll claims under these benefits must be made as per the process defined under Clause VI.4 of the policy.\n\nRegarding documentation, while the exact documents are not fully detailed in the provided text, it is implied that:\n\n- A written confirmation from the treating Medical Practitioner stating the medical necessity of domiciliary hospitalisation or home nursing is required.\n- The claim must be supported by hospital discharge documents confirming the inpatient treatment and discharge date.\n- Medical bills and receipts for the home nursing charges and related post-hospitalisation expenses must be submitted.\n- The claim process follows the procedures outlined in Clause VI.4.\n\nIn summary, home nursing charges after a serious accident and hospital discharge are reimbursable if they are part of accepted post-hospitalisation medical expenses related to the same illness or injury, within specified limits, and supported by medical practitioner confirmation and proper documentation as per the policy\u2019s claim process.", "In a multi-policy scenario where the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the following procedure applies for claim settlement, coordination, and documentation:\n\n1. **Claim Settlement and Coordination Procedure:**\n   - The Insured Person may choose any one policy for filing the claim settlement; the insurer of the chosen policy is treated as the primary insurer.\n   - If the coverage under the primary policy is insufficient to cover the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will request details of other available policies held by the policyholder.\n   - Upon receiving a written request from the Insured Person, the primary insurer will coordinate with the other insurers to ensure settlement of the balance claim amount as per the respective policy conditions.\n\n2. **Documentation Requirements:**\n   - The Insured Person must submit all relevant original documents related to the claim, including but not limited to:\n     - Medical history and consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for the current ailment.\n     - Bills with detailed breakup of charges and payment receipts, supported by prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner or hospital.\n     - Discharge certificate or summary from the hospital.\n     - Photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n     - Original final hospital bill with detailed breakup and all original deposit and final payment receipts.\n     - Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers for implants used during surgeries.\n     - All original diagnostic reports (imaging and laboratory) with medical practitioner\u2019s prescription and invoice/bill with receipt from diagnostic center.\n     - All original medicine/pharmacy bills with medical practitioner\u2019s prescription.\n     - MLC/FIR copy in accidental cases.\n     - Copy of death summary and death certificate in death claims.\n     - Pre and post-operative imaging reports.\n     - Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.\n     - Cheque copy with the proposer\u2019s name or bank passbook/bank statement not older than 3 months.\n   - In cases where the claim is lodged under the multiple policies settlement clause and original documents have already been submitted to another insurer, the company may accept duly certified copies of these documents and claim settlement advice certified by the other insurer, subject to the company\u2019s satisfaction.\n\n3. **Additional Claim Process Conditions:**\n   - The insured must comply with all policy terms and conditions, including timely payment of premiums.\n   - Treatment must be taken as per the directions and advice of the treating medical practitioner; failure to do so may prejudice the claim.\n   - The insured may be required to submit to medical examination by the insurer\u2019s medical practitioner or authorized representative.\n   - The insurer or its representatives must be permitted to inspect medical and hospitalization records and investigate claim circumstances.\n\nThis procedure ensures that when the primary policy coverage is insufficient, the claim is coordinated among multiple insurers to cover the admissible claim amount, provided the insured submits a written request and all required documentation as specified.", "Expenses related to hospitalization primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are explicitly excluded from claim coverage. Specifically, \"Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded,\" and \"Any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded\" (Code-Excl04). \n\nTherefore, if the insured's hospitalization was solely for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment, such expenses would not be claimable under the policy. This is because the hospitalization did not result in treatment but was only for diagnostic evaluation, which falls under the permanent exclusions.\n\nIn summary, hospitalization expenses incurred exclusively for evaluation and diagnostic purposes without subsequent treatment are excluded from claim reimbursement as per the policy definitions and exclusions.", "In the event of the sudden demise of the previous nominee and absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change, the insurer treats requests to update the nominee as follows:\n\n1. The insured person is required at the inception of the policy to make a nomination for claim payment purposes in the event of the policyholder's death. Any change of nomination must be communicated to the company in writing, and such change becomes effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made.\n\n2. If there is no subsisting nominee at the time of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the claim amount to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The discharge given by such legal heirs or representatives shall be treated as full and final discharge of the insurer's liability under the policy.\n\n3. Requests for endorsement, including change in nominee details, must be made in writing by the policyholder. All endorsement requests are assessed by the underwriter, and additional information, documents, or premium may be requested as necessary.\n\n4. The policy allows changes such as rectification in name, gender, relationship, age, correspondence address, contact details, and nominee details through endorsements during the policy period. However, these changes are effective only from the date the request is received or the date of premium receipt, whichever is later.\n\nTherefore, if the nominee has died and no prior endorsement for nominee change exists, the insurer will pay the claim to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. To update the nominee going forward, the policyholder must submit a written request for endorsement, which will be processed by the insurer with possible underwriting assessment and documentation requirements. Until such endorsement is made, the original nomination (if any) remains effective.", "Prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization, in the following scenarios based on definitions and exclusions:\n\n1. Prostheses, corrective devices, and/or medical appliances which are **not required intra-operatively** for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized. (Chunk 86)\n\n2. Non-medical expenses including ambulatory devices, walkers, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, glucometer/thermometer, and any medical equipment subsequently used at home, except when they form part of room expenses.

Devices used post-treatment or for home use, non-medical convenience items, devices for excluded conditions, or treatments not requiring hospitalization are excluded from coverage.", "Expenses for inpatient care for mental illness received from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally will not be reimbursed. This is because an \"AYUSH Day Care Centre\" or hospital eligible for reimbursement must be \"registered with the local authorities, wherever applicable,\" and must comply with specific criteria including having qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioner(s) in charge, dedicated AYUSH therapy sections, and maintaining daily patient records accessible to the insurance company\u2019s authorized representative. The presence of qualified practitioners alone is insufficient if the hospital is not registered locally.\n\nFurthermore, reimbursement claims require submission of original documents within prescribed time limits, including duly completed claim forms, photo ID, policy documents, and medical certificates from attending practitioners. Treatment in non-network or unregistered hospitals requires upfront payment by the insured, and claims are settled only on a reimbursement basis upon submission of all necessary documents.\n\nTherefore, since the AYUSH hospital is not registered locally, it does not meet the essential condition precedent for reimbursement, and expenses incurred there will not be eligible for reimbursement under the policy terms.", "If an insured requests a cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate, the hospital/provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or the associated TPA. This fresh authorization must be secured in accordance with the prescribed process for pre-authorization. Specifically, upon any change in diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the network provider is required to follow this step to maintain cashless eligibility.\n\nFurthermore, the cashless facility is limited exclusively to medical expenses incurred for treatment undertaken in a network provider hospital for covered illnesses or injuries. The insured person remains responsible for settling all non-admissible expenses, expenses above specified sub-limits (if applicable), co-payments, and/or opted deductibles directly with the hospital.\n\nIn summary, to maintain cashless eligibility after a treatment plan change with a higher estimate, the hospital/provider must:\n\n1. Obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer/TPA following the insurer\u2019s process for pre-authorization.\n2. Ensure that the updated treatment details are authorized before proceeding.\n3. Recognize that the insured must pay any non-medical or inadmissible expenses at discharge.\n\nFailure to provide relevant medical details may result in denial of pre-authorization, but such denial does not equate to denial of treatment or coverage.", "If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, the pre-hospitalization claim will not be processed independently. The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after the decision on the main Hospitalisation claim has been made. This means that the assessment and settlement of pre-hospitalization expenses are contingent upon acceptance of the inpatient hospitalization claim related to the same illness or injury.\n\nSpecifically, the policy requires that:\n\n- The inpatient hospitalization claim must be accepted first under the relevant clauses (III.A.1 or III.A.2).\n- The pre-hospitalization medical expenses must be related to the same illness or injury as the inpatient claim.\n- Only after the main hospitalization claim decision is made will the pre-hospitalization claim be processed.\n\nFurthermore, the claim assessment follows a progressive order where all admissible claims under the policy are assessed after applying proportionate clauses, co-pay, limits/sub-limits, and deductibles. Pre- and post-hospitalization claims are settled on a reimbursement basis upon production of relevant claim papers and cash receipts within the prescribed time limit.\n\nIn summary, submitting a pre-hospitalization claim before the inpatient hospitalization claim approval does not trigger immediate processing; the pre-hospitalization claim will be processed only after the main hospitalization claim decision is finalized.", "The policyholder's contact details are not explicitly provided in the text.

If the necessary claim documents are not provided or only partially provided within 10 working days of the first intimation, the claim may be affected. Claims, including rejection, are settled within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.\n\nTherefore, for claims with missing documents, if the deficiency is not rectified within the stipulated time, the claim may be denied.
