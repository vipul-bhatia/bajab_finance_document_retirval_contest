This is distinct from \"force,\" which he describes as an action that causes a change in a body's state of motion or rest, and which ceases to exist once the action is over.", "According to Newton, the three laws of motion are: Law I, stating that every body perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a right line unless compelled to change that state by impressed forces; Law II, asserting that the alteration of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and made in the direction of that force; and Law III, which posits that to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Newton's laws are fundamental to celestial mechanics, explaining the motions of planets, satellites, and comets by demonstrating how bodies, such as planets and comets in free space, preserve their progressive and circular motions for extended periods due to minimal resistance.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by considering a body acted upon by a centripetal force. He demonstrates that if this force acts in successive impulses, causing the body to move in straight lines within infinitesimal time intervals, the triangles formed by the center of force and consecutive positions of the body are equal in equal times. By composition, this means that equal areas are described in equal times, all lying within the same plane.", "Newton demonstrates that the force of gravity towards any particle of a body is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance from that particle. He further establishes that when two spheres mutually gravitate, their weight towards each other is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, provided the matter around their centers is similar and equidistant.", "Newton's argument for the universality of gravitational force stems from his observation that attractive forces are compounded from the forces of component parts, as seen in magnetic and electric attractions. He reasoned that since all terrestrial bodies, regardless of form, possess attractive forces proportional to their matter, these forces must also be present in celestial bodies, acting in proportion to their mass.", "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets arises from their mutual gravitational actions. These perturbations are generally small, though some, like the disturbance of Earth's orbit by the Moon, are noticeable, and significant ones occur, such as Jupiter's action on Saturn.", "In *Principia*, Newton utilized his \"Method of first and last ratios,\" which was a precursor to calculus. The provided text does not specify why he didn't use standard calculus notation.", "Newton explains orbital motion by defining centripetal force as that which draws bodies towards a center, like gravity drawing objects to Earth or the force keeping planets in orbit. Without this force, which opposes the natural tendency of bodies to move in straight lines, they would fly off into space.", "Newton suggests that a projectile moving swiftly in a fluid encounters resistance that is nearly in the duplicate ratio of its velocity. This resistance arises from the excess of fluid pressure at the front of the projectile compared to its rear, and it acts to retard the projectile's motion.", "Newton's concept of absolute space and time posits that space remains unchanging and immovable, and time flows equably regardless of external factors, forming the basis for true motion. This contrasts with relative motion, where an object's place and motion are defined by its relation to other moving objects, like a ship or the Earth. Absolute space and time provide an immovable reference frame against which all motions can be accurately measured and distinguished from apparent or relative motions, thereby supporting the understanding of forces that generate motion.", "Sir Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton. Beyond him, the text does not definitively trace his lineage.", "Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty. However, there are traditions suggesting their family was either of Scotch extraction or originated from Newton in Lancashire."]}
