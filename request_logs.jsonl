This is distinct from \"force,\" which is described as the action impressing motion upon bodies, consisting in the action itself and not remaining in the body once the action is over.", "Newton's first law states that a body persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by impressed forces, while the second law posits that the rate of change of motion is proportional to the motive force and made in the direction of the impressed force. The provided text also mentions that the motions of planets and comets in free spaces are preserved for a longer time due to less resistance, and that the transverse motion of bodies in orbits is related to their angular motion.", "Newton demonstrated that the principle of Universal Gravitation, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, explained Kepler's laws. This deduction, achieved by resolving forces and analyzing accelerations in relation to the path of a body, underpins his larger law, thereby proving the truth of Kepler's three laws.", "Newton inferred that the force retaining a planet in its orbit was directed towards the sun, and from the fact that planets move in ellipses with the sun at a focus, he drew the inference that the force varies inversely as the square of its distance therefrom. He demonstrated that a planet acted upon by such a force would move in a conic section, and that this force operated as if confined to the centers of spherical masses, meaning one body would act upon another with a force directly proportional to the quantity of matter and inversely as the square of the distance between their centers.", "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally stems from the principle that the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises from and is compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its parts. This is evidenced by observations showing that the attractive forces in terrestrial bodies are proportional to their quantities of matter and are not mutable with their forms, thus implying they are found in all sorts of bodies, celestial as well as terrestrial, in proportion to their matter.", "Newton explains that the perturbation of planetary orbits arises from the mutual actions of planets and comets in their revolutions, where the forces of gravity between these bodies cause deviations from their regular motions. This perturbation is greater in systems with more revolving bodies and is particularly noticeable, for example, in the orbit of Saturn due to Jupiter's influence.", "Newton utilized his binomial theorem, the method of first and last ratios, and concepts of fluxions and fluents as precursors to calculus, all developed from his study of Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites and the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. The provided text does not state why he did not use standard calculus notation.", "Newton explains orbital motion by positing that centripetal forces draw or impel bodies toward a central point, preventing them from flying off in straight lines and retaining them in curvilinear orbits. These forces are responsible for drawing bodies aside from the rectilinear motions they would otherwise pursue.", "Newton proposed that in resisting media, a body's resistance can be in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and that motion lost is proportional to the space traversed.", "Newton's notion of absolute space and time, which flows equably and remains immovable, differs from relative motion by defining it as the translation from one relative place to another, where true motion is generated by forces impressed upon the body moved, while relative motion can be altered without such forces. This distinction supports his laws by allowing for the determination of true, absolute motion through immovable places, which are foundational to understanding the motion of bodies.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.
