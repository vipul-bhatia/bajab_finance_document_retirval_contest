This exclusion is detailed under the Sterility and Infertility exclusion (Code \u2013 Excl 17), which states that expenses related to \"Assisted Reproduction services including artificial insemination and advanced reproductive technologies such as IVF\" are not covered.\n\nTherefore, even if you have incurred an IVF cost of Rs. 56,000, this expense is not covered by the policy.\n\nNo information in the provided text indicates any exceptions or coverage limits for IVF costs. Hence, IVF procedures and their related expenses are excluded from insurance coverage under this policy.", "For cataract treatment, the insurance policy covers medical expenses subject to a limit of 25% of the Sum Insured or Rs. 40,000 per eye, whichever is lower, during one policy year.

Equality and Non-Discrimination:  \n- Article 14 declares \"Equality before law\" and equal protection of the laws.  \n- Article 15(1) stipulates that \"The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of... sex...\" and Article 15(2) prohibits imposing any disability, restriction, or condition on citizens on grounds only of sex with regard to access.  \n- Article 16 ensures equality of opportunity in public employment without discrimination on grounds of sex, but this is less directly relevant to access to religious places.  \n- The State can make special provisions for women (Article 15(3)).\n\n2.

Moreover, the State may enact laws opening Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all Hindus without discrimination (Article 25(2)(b)).\n\nThe text does not explicitly state whether a religious place's refusal to admit women infringes constitutional rights or if this falls within the religious denomination\u2019s rights to manage religious affairs. The presence of exceptions and the allowance for managing religious affairs subject to public order suggests that such restrictions could be legal if they are integral to religious practice and do not violate public order, morality, or health. However, general prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sex by the State underscore that blanket exclusions could face constitutional challenges.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the provided text, whether stopping a woman from entering a religious place is constitutional depends on a balance between:  \n- The fundamental right against sex-based discrimination (Articles 14 and 15).  \n- The freedom of religion and the religious community\u2019s right to manage their affairs (Articles 25 and 26), subject to public order, morality, and health.  \n- The State\u2019s power to regulate religious institutions to enforce equality by opening Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all Hindus (Article 25(2)(b)).\n\nThe text does not provide a definitive ruling or explicit constitutional mandate on gender-based exclusion from religious places, only the framework within which such issues would be considered.", "Under Article 25 of the Constitution of India, \"all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,\" subject only to restrictions in the interests of public order, morality, and health.

Torture in custody would contravene these constitutional safeguards, violating the person\u2019s right to legal protection and remedy against such misconduct.\n\nHowever, the specific fundamental right that bans torture or cruel treatment by police in custody is not expressly spelled out in the provided text. The text affirms the existence of rights against unlawful detention and guarantees the right to approach courts for enforcing rights, but it does not explicitly name \"prohibition of torture\" as a fundamental right. Therefore, the violation concerns the infringement of fundamental rights protected under the Constitution, especially the right to constitutional remedies and lawful detention without excessive or unlawful force.\n\nHence, the right violated by police torture in custody is fundamentally the person\u2019s constitutional rights conferred under Part III, including the rights to legal remedy (Article 32) and protection from unlawful detention (Article 12(2)) as guaranteed by the Constitution of India.", "If you are denied admission to a public educational institution on grounds solely related to your belonging to a backward community, the Constitution of India provides protection against such discrimination.

Specifically, reservations for backward classes are provided in addition to existing reservations, subject to a maximum of ten per cent of total seats in each category.

The existence of reservations and special provisions for backward classes to ensure adequate representation.\n3.

Specifically, it is the sum of the motions of all the parts of a body; thus, in a body double in quantity but with equal velocity, the motion is doubled, and with twice the velocity, it is quadrupled. (Definitions I and II: quantity of matter relates to density and bulk; quantity of motion arises from quantity of matter and velocity together.)\n\nIn contrast, Newton defines \"force\" as an impressed action exerted upon a body to change its state, either from rest or of uniform motion in a right line. This impressed force acts only during the action and does not remain in the body when the action is over. The innate force of matter resisting change of state is called vis insita or force of inactivity (vis inertia), which is proportional to the body and distinct from impressed force.\n\nThus, \"quantity of motion\" quantifies the amount of motion a body possesses based on mass and velocity, while \"force\" refers to the external cause or action exerted upon a body to alter its state of motion. Moreover, true motion (related to quantity of motion) can only be generated or altered by impressed forces, whereas relative motion may change without any force impressed on the body itself.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Quantity of motion = measure of matter times velocity; the total motion of all parts combined.\n\n- Force = an action impressed upon a body to change its motion; it does not persist in the body once exerted.\n\nThis distinction highlights that \"quantity of motion\" is a property or measure of a body's motion, while \"force\" is the external cause effecting changes in that motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are stated as follows:\n\n1. **Law I:** \"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.\" This means that a body will maintain its current state of motion or rest unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n2. **Law II:** \"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\" This implies that the change in motion (momentum) is directly proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of that force. For example, a double force will generate double the motion.\n\n3. **Law III:** \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\" This means that forces always come in pairs equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nIn celestial mechanics, these laws underpin the understanding of planetary and satellite motions:\n\n- The law of falling bodies at Earth's surface was identified with the same force guiding the moon in her orbit, leading Newton to unify terrestrial and celestial motions under one law.\n\n- Newton extended these principles to formulate about twelve propositions on the motion of primary planets, explaining and harmonizing diverse celestial phenomena including planets, satellites, and comets.\n\n- The principle of Universal Gravitation\u2014every particle of matter attracts every other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them\u2014was deduced from the moon\u2019s motion and Kepler\u2019s three laws, which Newton demonstrated to be true by his universal law.\n\n- The centripetal force acting on planets decreases in inverse proportion to the square of the distance, which explains their periodic times and orbits. This force acts proportionally to the planets\u2019 masses, ensuring regular motion of planets and their satellites.\n\n- Newton showed that the same gravitational force attracting the planets also attracts their satellites and the Earth-Moon system, thereby governing orbital motions throughout the solar system.\n\n- Newton also reasoned that mutual gravitational forces between bodies in the system are proportional to their masses, and the orbits of planets about a great central body are ellipses with the central body at one focus, as per the derived propositions.\n\nThus, Newton's laws describe how forces cause changes in motion and interactions between bodies, and when combined with his law of universal gravitation, they precisely explain the motions of celestial bodies in the solar system.", "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law\u2014that planets describe equal areas in equal times\u2014by applying his laws of motion and the concept of centripetal force as follows:\n\n1. He considers a body moving along a path subjected to a centripetal force directed towards a fixed centre (e.g., the sun). When this force acts successively at discrete points in time, it produces changes in the body's velocity perpendicular to its path, deflecting it from a straight-line motion into a curved orbit within a fixed plane (Chunk 267).\n\n2. By constructing triangles formed by the radius vector from the centre of force to the moving body and the path increment of the body in each equal time interval, Newton demonstrates that these triangles have equal areas. Since these triangles lie in the same, immovable plane and each corresponds to the area swept out by the radius vector in equal successive time intervals, the areas described are equal in equal times (Chunk 267).\n\n3. Newton further resolves the forces acting on the orbiting body into two components: one directed along the radius vector, which neither accelerates nor retards the area description, and another perpendicular to the radius, which affects the velocity along the path. Since the radial component does not change the area swept out, the area velocity remains constant under a centripetal force (Chunk 1193).\n\n4. The centripetal force, by always acting towards the centre, continually changes the direction but not the magnitude of the area velocity, ensuring that the radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Chunks 446, 267).\n\n5. Additionally, Newton's second law of motion\u2014\"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed\"\u2014supports the resolution of the force into radial (centripetal) and tangential components, where only the perpendicular component alters the path but preserves the area swept per time (Chunk 203, 446).\n\n6. Thus, by integrating his laws of motion and universal gravitation framed as a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the distance, Newton mathematically proves that the radius vector from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time, which is the precise statement of Kepler\u2019s Second Law (Chunks 267, 1193, 203).\n\nIn summary, Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law is built on analyzing the effects of the centripetal force acting towards a fixed centre on a moving body, resolving the forces according to his laws of motion, and demonstrating geometrically and mathematically that in equal times the radius vector describes equal areas in the fixed orbital plane.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by considering the force of gravity arising from the attractions of all the component parts of a larger body (such as a planet) acting on a smaller body. He reasons that the total gravitational force towards a whole planet is compounded from the forces of gravity exerted by each part of the planet, each of which diminishes in proportion to the reciprocal of the square of the distance from that part (Chunk 1124). Newton initially doubted whether this reciprocal duplicate proportion (inverse square law) would hold accurately near the planet's surface due to unequal and dissimilar particle distances, but using additional propositions and corollaries (Props. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I), he was satisfied of its truth.\n\nHe further shows through geometric and mathematical reasoning (Propositions such as LXII, XXXV, LXXIV, and applicable corollaries) that the attraction of a spherical mass on a corpuscle outside the sphere acts as if all the mass were concentrated at its center, thereby making the gravitational force between two spheres reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance between their centers (Chunks 613, 614, and 1124).\n\nThis reasoning involves dividing a sphere into concentric spherical surfaces and summing their attractions, each inversely proportional to the square of the corpuscle\u2019s distance from the center (Chunk 613). The force of attraction thus follows a \"reciprocal duplicate ratio\" of the distances, meaning the force varies inversely as the square of the distance.\n\nIn summary, Newton\u2019s method demonstrates the inverse square law by:\n\n1. Decomposing gravitational force into the sum of forces from constituent particles, each decreasing with the square of distance.\n\n2. Employing propositions and corollaries to prove that these combined forces from a spherical mass act effectively as if concentrated at its center.\n\n3. Confirming that the weight (gravitational force) between two spheres is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, satisfying the inverse square relationship universally for celestial and terrestrial bodies.\n\nThus, the universal law of gravitation is established as a mutual attraction between masses, proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.", "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act universally on all masses proceeds from empirical observations and logical deduction about the nature of gravitation. Firstly, experiments and astronomical observations show that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards it in proportion to the quantity of matter they contain; similarly, the moon gravitates towards the earth, the earth's seas towards the moon, planets mutually towards one another, and comets towards the sun. This consistent pattern across celestial and terrestrial bodies leads to the necessary conclusion that a principle of mutual gravitation exists universally among all bodies whatsoever.\n\nNewton reasons that since gravity is proved to exist between every particle of matter, and since a larger body can be considered as composed of numerous smaller parts each gravitating according to their matter content, the force of the whole body must arise from the summation of the forces of its component parts. Hence, all bodies must attract each other mutually according to their quantities of matter. Although mutual gravitation of small terrestrial bodies is not readily observed because the forces are exceedingly minute compared to the earth\u2019s influence (and thus fall below the threshold of sensory observation), it must exist universally by analogy and necessity.\n\nMoreover, since there is no difference in substance among bodies, only differences of modes and forms, forces proportional to the quantities of matter found in terrestrial bodies must be found in all kinds of bodies, celestial as well as terrestrial. This universal proportionality, combined with the inverse square dependence on distance between centers of mass, forms the basis of the universal law of gravitation.\n\nTherefore, Newton\u2019s argument hinges upon:  \n1. The universal observational fact that all bodies gravitate towards each other proportionally to their matter content.  \n2. The conceptual decomposition of a body into constituent parts whose mutual attractions sum to the force of the whole.  \n3. The negligible but existent mutual attraction among smaller bodies consistent with this law.  \n4. The uniformity of matter across bodies ensuring that these forces are universal.\n\nThis reasoning transcends terrestrial phenomena, encompassing planetary and celestial motions, thus establishing gravitation as a universal mutual force acting on all masses.", "Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets by recognizing that all planets mutually attract each other by gravity according to the \"Law III\" of motion (action and equal reaction) and that the force of gravity is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres. Each planet\u2019s gravitational influence is compounded from the attractions of its constituent parts, and these mutual attractions cause deviations from the ideal elliptical motions relative to the sun.\n\nSpecifically, the perturbation arises because the gravitational force exerted by one planet on another, while much weaker than the sun's force, is not negligible. For example, the force of gravity towards Jupiter compared to the sun is as 1 to 1067 at equal distances, and when Saturn is near Jupiter, the proportion of the forces can become significant (about 1 to 211), creating perturbations in Saturn's orbit at every conjunction with Jupiter, which are large enough to puzzle astronomers.\n\nNewton's method involves resolving these forces into components and analyzing their effects on the longitude and latitude of the orbits. Perturbing forces acting not only alter the longitude but also draw the planet out of the plane of its orbit (introducing a latitude perturbation), proportional to the magnitude of the perturbing force component. When forces act equally and in parallel directions, they cause no perturbation; thus, perturbations arise from inequalities in the gravitational attractions between the planets.\n\nMoreover, Newton considers the planets and other revolving bodies as parts of a system where the greater the number and mass of revolving bodies, the greater the perturbations caused by their mutual attractions (because of increased inclinations and inequalities in proportions of distance and acceleration). He demonstrates that the motions remain elliptical about their common or centers of gravity but are disturbed by these additional forces, especially when the common center of gravity moves, increasing perturbations.\n\nNewton also notes that these perturbations can lead to slow changes in orbital elements such as aphelions and nodes, but these changes are very small and often nearly quiescent, especially given the dominance of the sun's gravitational force. The perturbations can cause slow progressions or regressions of nodes and aphelions, similar to those observed in the moon\u2019s orbit.\n\nIn sum, Newton explains planetary orbit perturbations by analyzing the mutual gravitational attractions between planets, their compounded forces from constituent parts, differences in force magnitudes and directions, and their effects on orbital motions, resulting in small but measurable deviations from ideal elliptical orbits about the sun.", "Newton used the \"method of fluxions\" in Principia as a precursor to calculus. This method involved viewing lines or quantities (called \"fluents\") as generated by the motion of points, lines, or surfaces, with their velocities of generation termed \"fluxions.\" He applied his celebrated \"Binomial Theorem\" to rectify curves and determine areas and volumes by considering these quantities as continuously increasing (\"nascent quantities\") with fluxions proportional to the ordinates. He deduced velocities from equations and employed infinite series to find ultimate values. Importantly, this method worked with limits (the \"first and last sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities\") rather than indivisibles, ensuring more geometrical rigor and safety in demonstrations.\n\nNewton did not use the standard calculus notation employed by Leibniz (such as the letter \"d\" for differences) because he preferred a geometrical and synthetic approach rather than algebraic symbolism. He named the quantities differently\u2014calling them moments or fluxions rather than differentials\u2014and avoided Leibniz's notation. Newton censured the handling of geometrical subjects by algebraical calculations, favoring geometrical methods for clearer and more rigorous demonstrations. His preference was not a mere matter of taste but a deliberate choice to maintain the strength and appropriateness of the geometrical method in his Principia.\n\nThus, Newton's mathematical tools in Principia were the fluxionary calculus based on nascent and evanescent quantities and limits, applied through geometrical reasoning and infinite series, and he avoided standard algebraic calculus notation due to his strong preference for geometric methods over algebraical formulations.", "Newton employs the concept of centripetal force as a mathematical principle to explain orbital motion by defining it as a force directed towards some center which restrains a body in its orbit, opposing its natural tendency to move off in a straight line. He illustrates this with the analogy of a stone in a sling, where the centripetal force acts towards the hand at the center, continuously drawing the stone inward and keeping it in orbit. In the case of planets, this centripetal force is directed towards the Sun (or other central bodies, termed circumsolar, circum-terrestrial, etc.) and is responsible for retaining the planets within their orbits rather than allowing them to move in straight lines. \n\nNewton shows that this force varies inversely as the square of the distance from the orbit\u2019s center and that under such a force a body can only move in conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola). He demonstrates that the force responsible for orbital motion\u2014gravitational attraction\u2014acts as if concentrated at the centers of spherical bodies and is directly proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This centripetal force constantly changes the direction of the planet\u2019s motion without changing its speed tangent to the orbit, thus causing curved motion around the center. Newton resolves the planet\u2019s motion into components: one directed towards the center (centripetal), which acts to draw the planet inward, and the other transverse to it, which is responsible for the angular motion. The equality and ratio of these components govern the path of the orbit.\n\nThus, Newton's method is to abstract all forces acting towards the orbit\u2019s center into the single mathematical concept of centripetal force, characterize its magnitude and direction based on observational phenomena and laws of motion, and then apply this to deduce the possible orbital paths and dynamics of bodies such as planets, using mathematical demonstrations grounded on the inverse-square law of attraction and resolving motions into centripetal and transverse components.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, by analyzing the resistance forces exerted by the medium on a moving body and relating these resistances to the body's velocity, shape, and the properties of the medium. His method involves examining the interactions between the moving body and the particles of the medium and establishing mathematical relationships for resistance and motion reduction. Key points of his treatment are:\n\n1. **Resistance Proportional to the Square of Velocity (Nearly):**  \n   In elastic fluids like air, the resistance encountered by a swiftly moving body is \"nearly in the duplicate ratio of its velocity,\" meaning it is proportional to the square of the velocity (Chunk 907). This resistance arises because the body excites motion in the fluid particles, and the accelerative forces by which the fluid's particles mutually act are proportional to the bodies\u2019 diameters inversely and the square of their velocities directly (Chunk 907).\n\n2. **Resistance depends on Density Ratios:**  \n   Newton shows that the resistance a body meets is proportional to the ratio of the density of the medium to the density of the body (Chunks 921, 955). For example, a globe moving uniformly will transfer motion to fluid particles proportionally, and the resistance is proportional to the medium\u2019s density divided by the body\u2019s density.\n\n3. **Effect of Elasticity and Particle Interaction in Medium:**  \n   The resistance is influenced by whether the medium\u2019s particles mutually repel or fly apart. When the distant particles of the medium \"do not act mutually with any force,\" the resistance is exactly proportional to the square of velocity (Chunk 908). If elasticity arises from centrifugal forces among particles, the resistance of moving bodies of equal velocity in an elastic fluid will be proportional to the square of their diameters nearly (Chunk 911). Further, if particle elasticity arises from other causes that hinder particle motion (like expansion as in wool or boughs), the resistance will be greater due to less fluidity (Chunk 913).\n\n4. **Resistance by Reflection and Particle Interaction Cases:**  \n   Newton distinguishes cases depending on how particles in the medium react when encountered by a moving body:  \n   - Case 1: Particles reflected perfectly, yielding the highest resistance.   \n   - Case 2: Particles are not reflected but acquire the velocity of the body, making resistance half as great as in Case 1.  \n   - Case 3: Particles rebound with some intermediate force, producing resistance between Cases 1 and 2 (Chunk 922).\n\n5. **Pressure Due to Fluid Compression Does Not Change Resistance:**  \n   The pressure from compression of the fluid, propagated instantly through the fluid, produces no motion in the fluid parts and therefore does not augment or lessen resistance (Chunk 956). The resistance is due to the motion generated in the fluid parts themselves by the moving body.\n\n6. **Resistance Related to Motion Loss and Space Traversed:**  \n   When a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, the motion lost through resistance is proportional to the space it travels; this links resistance directly to velocity and displacement (Chunk 694).\n\n7. **Friction and Mutual Impulses Between Fluid Layers:**  \n   In fluids, there is an implication of mutual impressions (shearing forces) among concentric layers or orbs of fluid, which must balance for uniform motion of each layer. If impressions differ on convex versus concave sides of an orb, it affects acceleration or retardation of that orb's velocity (Chunk 1052).\n\nIn summary, Newton's approach mathematically relates the resistance of a fluid medium to the velocity, size, and density of bodies, explains resistance as arising from the transfer of motion to fluid particles, and accounts for different physical cases of particle interaction and elasticity within the fluid, providing formulas and proportionalities to determine the resistance experienced by bodies moving in air or fluids.", "Newton\u2019s notion of absolute space and time differs fundamentally from relative motion by their nature and how they underpin true motion, which supports his laws:\n\n1. Absolute Space and Time:  \n- Absolute space \"in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.\" (Chunk 182)  \n- Absolute time \"flows equably without regard to anything external,\" and is identified with \"duration,\" which is immutable and unaffected by changes in motion. (Chunks 182, 188)  \n- Absolute space and time exist independently of sensory experience or relative positions and serve as the true reference frame for motion. (Chunk 182)\n\n2. Relative Space and Time:  \n- Relative space is a \"movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces,\" determined by the position of bodies and variable with respect to them, such as a part of a ship or the earth. (Chunks 182, 185)  \n- Relative motion is the translation of a body from one relative place to another, depending on the chosen reference frame and can be altered without forces acting on the body itself. (Chunks 184, 185, 193)\n\n3. Difference between Absolute and Relative Motion:  \n- Absolute (or true) motion is the translation from one absolute place to another within immovable space and cannot be created or changed without an impressed force directly on the moving body. (Chunks 184, 193)  \n- Relative motion may change without any force on the body, merely by forces acting on other bodies used for comparison, altering relative position but not true motion. (Chunk 193)  \n- For example, a sailor walking on a ship moving on the earth: the sailor\u2019s true motion in immovable absolute space is the sum of the earth\u2019s true motion plus the relative motions of the ship on the earth and of the sailor on the ship; relative motion on earth is their composite relative to the earth. (Chunk 186)\n\n4. Support for Newton\u2019s Laws:  \n- Newton\u2019s laws describe motions that result from forces applied to bodies. Since true motion \"is neither generated nor altered but by some force impressed upon the body moved,\" absolute space and time provide the consistent framework within which forces cause true changes in motion.

Thus, a dental surgery following an accident can be claimed only if it meets the hospitalisation criterion of at least 24 hours.\n\nFor the claim process, it is a condition precedent for admission of liability that premium payments are made in full and on time, and the insured must comply with the claim procedure (Chunk 114). Upon injury or accident, treatment must follow the directions of the treating Medical Practitioner; failure to do so prejudices the claim. The insured must submit to medical examination by the insurer\u2019s medical practitioner if requested, and the insurer has the right to inspect medical and hospital records and investigate claim circumstances (Chunk 114).\n\nThe insured person should submit the claim form along with invoices, the treating Medical Practitioner\u2019s prescription, and reports to the insurer\u2019s branch or head office for assessment (Chunk 131).

The New Born Baby Benefit Cover applies from birth if the mother is insured and maternity cover is opted, subject to written notification by the last day of the month following birth and payment of the agreed premium (Chunk 100). The newborn is covered from Day 1 within the family Sum Insured (Chunk 5).\n\nRegarding treatment expenses for the newborn, including intensive care required due to complications after birth, the policy recognizes ICU charges defined as expenses towards ICU bed, medical support, monitoring, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges (Chunk 45). Newborn's treatment expenses, if medically necessary and admitted as inpatient, should be eligible under the family Sum Insured, provided the newborn is accepted as an Insured Person on notification and premium payment.\n\nHowever, certain exclusions apply that might affect claim eligibility: any expenses not medically necessary, outpatient treatments not requiring hospitalization, congenital anomalies (external or internal) may affect claims only if specifically excluded, and treatments not supported by prescriptions are excluded (Chunks 84, 85). The policy covers maternity expenses as medical treatment traceable to childbirth including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections but does not explicitly exclude newborn intensive care costs if the newborn is admitted under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover (Chunks 83, 45).\n\nIn the case of a newborn\u2019s death within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care, claim eligibility for the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses depends on acceptance of the newborn as Insured by written notification and premium payment on or before the last day of the month following birth (Chunk 100). Death claim procedures require submission of appropriate documents including death certificate and medical records (Chunk 121, Chunk 128). The insurer\u2019s liability to pay arises only after due premium payment and fulfillment of all policy terms (Chunk 100).\n\nNo specific exclusion explicitly denies coverage of newborn intensive care or treatment in case the newborn expires within 24 hours. Coverage is contingent on the newborn being enrolled as an Insured Person timely and the claim being compliant with notification and documentation requirements. If all conditions precedent, including premium payment and claim notification, are met, expenses related to the newborn\u2019s intensive care should be claim eligible under the family Sum Insured as part of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, subject to policy terms, reasonable and medically necessary treatment, and no applicable exclusion.\n\nIn summary:\n- Newborn is covered from birth if mother has maternity cover and newborn enrolled timely with premium paid.\n- Maternity cover includes complicated C-section expenses up to INR 50,000.\n- Newborn\u2019s ICU and treatment expenses are covered if medically necessary and admitted inpatient.\n- Exclusions apply to non-medically necessary treatments, outpatient care, or unsupported treatments.\n- Claim for newborn\u2019s treatment after birth, even if newborn expires within 24 hours, is eligible if newborn is enrolled as Insured Person, premium paid, and requisite claim documentation provided.\n- Death claims require death certificate and medical records submission.\n- The insurer\u2019s liability is conditional on fulfillment of all policy terms and premium payment.\n\nThis defines the eligibility for claim of the newborn\u2019s treatment expenses after a complicated C-section delivery with newborn demise within 24 hours, based strictly on the insured\u2019s coverage terms, defined newborn benefit cover, exclusions, and procedural requirements in the provided policy text.", "A claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment supported by a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is insufficient for claim admissibility.\n\nThis is because:\n\n1. Eligible mental health professionals for claims include \"a psychiatrist,\" \"a professional registered with the concerned State Authority,\" or \"a Clinical Psychologist\" possessing recognized qualifications as defined. A Clinical Psychologist is defined as a person having either:\n   (i) A recognised qualification in Clinical Psychology from an institution approved and recognised by the Rehabilitation Council of India, or\n   (ii) A Post-Graduate degree in Psychology or Clinical Psychology or Applied Psychology plus a Master of Philosophy in Clinical Psychology or Medical and Social Psychology obtained after full-time supervised clinical training from a recognized university, approved by the Rehabilitation Council of India.\n\n2. The claim documentation rules for treatment require the submission of the attending Medical Practitioner's prescription along with supporting documents such as discharge summaries from hospitals. The \"attending Medical Practitioner\" is the treating Medical Practitioner or Specialist Medical Practitioner, typically a qualified medical doctor.\n\n3. A prescription from a general practitioner (not specified as a Specialist Medical Practitioner or treating Psychiatrist) does not meet the requirement for a Specialist Medical Practitioner's prescription for mental health inpatient treatment claims.\n\n4. A discharge summary certified by a \"registered Clinical Psychologist\" is acceptable only if the Clinical Psychologist holds the recognized qualifications described above. However, the discharge summary alone from the Clinical Psychologist is not a substitute for the mandatory prescription or certificate from the treating Medical Practitioner or Psychiatrist.\n\n5. Claims Procedure states that treatment should be taken as per the advice of the treating Medical Practitioner, and the claim must be supported by the attending Medical Practitioner's documentation including prescriptions specifying diagnosis and medical necessity.\n\nTherefore, a general practitioner's prescription plus discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist does not satisfy the claim conditions, as the prescription should come from the treating Medical Practitioner or Specialist Medical Practitioner (including a psychiatrist), and Clinical Psychologist qualifications must be recognized as defined. Also, the claim documents must include appropriate medical certificates/prescriptions from eligible medical specialists, not just supporting documents from psychologists. \n\nHence, for an inpatient psychiatric treatment claim, supporting documents must include a prescription from a qualified treating Medical Practitioner (typically a psychiatrist or specialist doctor), and the discharge summary must be from the hospital or treating medical facility, properly certified by eligible mental health professionals as per definitions. A general practitioner's prescription alone is inadequate.", "ECG electrodes are admissible with constraints: up to 5 electrodes are payable for every case visiting the Operation Theatre (OT) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

However, related consumables such as \"face mask,\" \"flexi mask,\" \"disinfectant lotions,\" and other incidental items are listed, but gloves are not specifically stated as payable.\n\nTherefore, only ECG electrodes are admissible under specified constraints for reimbursement during oral chemotherapy sessions at a network hospital; gloves are not indicated as reimbursable items in the annexures.", "For expenses related to an illness requiring hospitalization, the policy covers both pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation medical expenses under specified conditions and limits:\n\n1. **Pre-hospitalisation Expenses:**  \n   - These are covered on a reimbursement basis if incurred due to the same Illness or Injury for which hospitalization occurred.  \n   - Coverage applies only if the medical expenses are incurred within the number of days and up to the amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance (whichever is less).  \n   - The date of hospital admission considered for these benefits is the insured person's first admission related to that illness.  \n   - In this case, since the pre-hospitalisation expenses were incurred 18 days before admission, whether these are covered depends on their falling within the specified pre-hospitalisation period limit stated in the Policy Schedule (not detailed in the text).  \n   - All claims must follow the prescribed process and be supported by relevant documentation.\n\n2. **Post-hospitalisation Expenses:**  \n   - Covered on a reimbursement basis for medical expenses incurred following discharge from hospital for the same Illness or Injury during the Policy Period.  \n   - Coverage extends up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance (whichever is less).  \n   - The date of discharge for this benefit is the insured person's last discharge related to the illness for which inpatient hospitalization was accepted.  \n   - Since the infection requiring diagnostic tests and pharmacy expenses developed 20 days after discharge, these expenses may be eligible provided they fall within the post-hospitalisation limit days and amount set by the policy.  \n   - The claim must be submitted along with original cash receipts and supporting medical documents within stipulated timelines (typically within 15 days of completion of post-hospitalisation treatment).  \n   - The post-hospitalisation medical expenses must be directly related to the same illness that led to the original hospitalization and accepted inpatient claim.\n\n3. **Other Considerations:**  \n   - Both pre- and post-hospitalisation claims are reimbursed only after accepting the inpatient hospitalisation claim under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2.  \n   - Expenses must be medically necessary and prescribed by the treating Medical Practitioner related to the illness.  \n   - Charges covered include diagnostic tests, medicines, and pharmacy expenses directly linked to the illness.  \n   - Expenses not related to the current diagnosis are excluded.  \n   - Documentation including duly completed claim forms, medical certificates, diagnostic reports, and cash receipts are essential for claim settlement.\n\nIn summary, pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission can be claimed if they fall within the policy\u2019s specified pre-hospitalisation period and limits for the same illness. Post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge (such as diagnostics and pharmacy for the infection) can be claimed provided they fall within the post-hospitalisation time frame and amount limits stated in the policy schedule and are related to the accepted inpatient claim. Both claims are subject to policy terms, limits, and submission of proper medical and financial documentation within prescribed timelines.", "Dependent children are covered up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Coverage continues along with the parents until the dependent child reaches this age limit. If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, the coverage will not continue beyond that age under normal eligibility criteria.\n\nRegarding premium payment timing, since the premium is paid at the beginning of the coverage year, coverage for that dependent child would remain in effect until the policy end date of that policy year. Coverage termination occurs when the dependent ceases to be eligible (i.e., after crossing the age limit of 26 years), unless otherwise specifically agreed for continuation till the end of the policy period.\n\nDeletion protocols require notification of changes in membership on or before the last day of the succeeding month following any event warranting deletion. Coverage will end immediately upon termination conditions, which include the dependent ceasing to be a dependent unless continuation till end of policy period is specifically agreed.\n\nIn summary:  \n- Coverage for the dependent child who turns 27 during the policy period continues until the end of that policy period because the premium was paid for the entire policy year upfront.  \n- Coverage terminates at the policy expiry date, or earlier if the dependent ceases to be eligible (turns 27), unless specific agreement is made to continue to policy end.  \n- Deletion of the dependent must be notified timely, and coverage ends immediately upon ineligibility unless continuation is agreed until the policy\u2019s expiration.\n\nThis aligns with the conditions that children above 18 years are covered until 26 years old if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, and that termination for dependents occurs when they cease to be dependents unless otherwise agreed for continuation till policy end.", "When an insured person opts for a single private room whose rent exceeds the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, the reimbursement of all associated medical expenses\u2014including diagnostic and specialist fees billed separately\u2014is subject to the \"Proportionate Clause.\" This clause states that the payment for all such medical expenses incurred at the hospital shall be made \"in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of Room Rent.\" \n\nSpecifically:\n- Room, boarding, and nursing expenses are covered up to the limit specified or actual expenses, whichever is less.\n- Charges for accommodation such as ICU/CCU/HDU are similarly limited.\n- Medical Practitioner, Surgeon, Specialist, and Anaesthetist fees are billed separately but subject to proportionate deduction if differential billing is adopted.\n- Investigative tests or diagnostic procedures related to the hospitalisation, such as radiology and pathology tests, are also subject to this proportionate reimbursement.\n\nHowever, proportionate deductions are not applied in cases where hospitals do not follow differential billing or for expenses where differential billing does not depend on the room category.\n\nThe relevant clause governing this reimbursement is the \"Proportionate Clause\" defined under the policy clauses concerning inpatient hospitalisation expenses and room rent limits, referenced as Clause III.A.1.A and elaborated in the policy provisions regarding room rent limits and reimbursement of associated expenses. All claims under this benefit are processed as per the procedures defined in Clause VI.3 and 4.\n\nIn summary, when room rent exceeds the insured limit, all associated medical expenses including diagnostic and specialist fees are reimbursed proportionately to the admissible room rent limit relative to the actual room rent charged, unless differential billing is not practiced by the hospital. This is governed by the \"Proportionate Clause\" under Clause III.A.1.A and related sub-clauses in the policy document.", "If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insurer will notify the insured of the deficiency. The insured has up to 10 working days from the first intimation to submit the missing or additional necessary documents. During this period, a maximum of three reminders may be sent by the insurer. If the insured submits the documents after these 10 days, the claim may still be processed depending on the insurer\u2019s discretion; they may decide to deduct the amount corresponding to the deficient documents and settle the claim if it is otherwise valid.\n\nOnce the insurer receives all necessary documents, they will assess the claim and communicate the final decision\u2014acceptance or rejection\u2014within 15 days of receipt of the last required document. If the claim is finally rejected, the insurer will provide a written communication explicitly stating the grounds for rejection within 15 days from the receipt of the final documents or investigation report.\n\nFollowing a final rejection, the insured may contest the decision by representing for its reconsideration within 15 days from the date of receipt of the claims decision. This constitutes the grievance procedure available for the insured to challenge the rejection.\n\nRegarding timelines for claim submission, reimbursement claims related to hospitalization and pre- and post-hospitalization expenses must be submitted within 15 days of discharge or completion of post-hospitalization treatment. Documents must be in the insured\u2019s name, and original medical and hospital-related papers must be provided.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Deficiency in documents will be intimated; insured has 10 working days to comply.\n\n- Up to three reminders may be sent during this period.\n\n- Late submission after 10 days may still be considered, potentially with deductions.\n\n- Final claim decisions are communicated within 15 days of receipt of complete documentation.\n\n- Reasons for rejection are communicated explicitly in writing.\n\n- The insured may represent for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving rejection.\n\nThis is the prescribed claim timeline and grievance procedure in case of partial or final claim rejection due to documentation deficiencies.", "The claim for hospitalization of an insured person undergoing minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia, with a hospital stay of 22 hours, is eligible if it meets the criteria for specified procedures where the minimum admission period can be less than 24 consecutive hours.\n\nRelevant category and requirements:\n\n- \"Hospitalisation means admission in a Hospital for a minimum period of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours except for specified procedures/treatments, where such admission could be for a period of less than 24 consecutive hours.\" (Chunk 43)\n\nThis implies that for certain specified procedures, including modern minimally invasive surgeries benefiting from technological advancements (reducing the usual hospital stay from more than 24 hours to less), claims are admissible even if the insured's hospital stay is less than 24 hours.\n\nAdditional relevant points:\n\n- The hospital must fulfill standard criteria (qualified nursing staff round the clock, minimum inpatient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge 24/7, fully equipped operation theater, and maintain daily accessible patient records) to be valid for claim purposes. (Chunk 43)\n\n- The minimally invasive surgery, indicated as a modern treatment benefiting from technological advances, falls under \"Modern Treatment Methods & Advancement in Technologies,\" which are covered under the policy when medically indicated either as inpatient or day care treatment. (Chunks 71 and 72)\n\nTherefore, if the surgery qualifies as a specified procedure under modern treatments, the claim is eligible despite hospitalization for less than 24 hours (in this case, 22 hours).

This coverage applies regardless of whether the surgery is performed as a day care procedure or during inpatient hospitalization. There are additional sub-limits applicable to modern treatment methods and advancements in technology, which include robotic surgery, restricting coverage to the specified limits per the policy.

For emergency hospitalisation, notification must be within 24 hours of hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier. (Chunk 115)\n2. **Pre-Authorization for Emergency Evacuation:** Emergency medical evacuations, including air ambulance, must be pre-authorised by the insurer. The insurer\u2019s specialists, in association with the emergency assistance provider, will determine the medical necessity of the evacuation and approve the same. (Chunk 132)\n3. **Medical Details:** The insured must provide relevant medical details to support the pre-authorization; failure to do so may result in denial of pre-authorization (which is not denial of treatment or coverage). Any changes in diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalisation require the Network Provider to obtain fresh authorization. (Chunk 118, Chunk 132)\n4. **Network Provider:** Cashless facility is available only in network/PPN hospitals and is subject to pre-authorization by the TPA. (Chunk 115)\n\n**Claims Assessment and Documentation:**\n1. **Claim Notification:** The insured or nominee must notify the TPA in writing with relevant claim information including plan of treatment and policy number within prescribed time limits (24 hours for emergency hospitalisation). (Chunk 115)\n2. **Investigation & Cooperation:** The insurer or its authorized representatives have the right to examine the insured medically, inspect hospitalisation and treatment records, and investigate claim circumstances. The insured must cooperate fully in this process. (Chunks 114, 115)\n3. **Claim Assessment:** Claims are assessed in the following progressive order: \n   - Application of proportionate clause,\n   - Co-pay applicability,\n   - Limits/sub-limits as per policy schedule,\n   - Opted deductibles (per claim/aggregate). (Chunk 124)\n4. **Payment:** For cashless claims, payment is made directly to the Network Provider.

(Chunk 113)\n\nIn summary, for an accident requiring air ambulance evacuation and inpatient admission, immediate notification and pre-authorization are mandatory. Air ambulance use must be medically necessary and pre-authorized. Claims are assessed with due application of policy terms including co-pay, limits, and deductibles. Full cooperation in investigation and submission of comprehensive documentation including hospital records, bills, FIR/MLC (for accidents), pre-authorization letters, and air ambulance tickets is required to process the claim.", "If an insured person has prior continuous coverage without any break under a health insurance policy with an Indian General/Health Insurer and then ports to this policy, the waiting periods applicable to specific illnesses, such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis, will be reduced to the extent of the prior coverage as per IRDAI guidelines on portability.\n\nSpecifically, expenses related to treatment of listed specific illnesses\u2014including knee replacement surgery (other than caused by an accident), osteoarthritis, and related conditions\u2014are subject to a specific waiting period. This specific waiting period applies from the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer for the continuous coverage period mentioned in the policy schedule or Certificate of Insurance. However, if the insured has continuous coverage without any lapse as defined under portability norms, the waiting period for the same illness or surgery will be proportionally reduced by crediting the prior coverage duration.\n\nAdditionally, if there is an enhancement in sum insured, the waiting period exclusion applies afresh only to the increased portion of the sum insured.\n\nThus, after porting, the waiting period for a specific illness like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis is not restarted but is adjusted by deducting the duration of continuous prior coverage under the previous insurer, provided there has been no break in coverage. This accrued continuity benefit ensures the insured gains credit for previously served waiting periods under portability regulations.", "If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, the expense will be covered only if the medication is prescribed by a medical practitioner and is part of \"Medically Necessary Treatment.\" \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" is defined as treatment which:\n\ni. Is required for the medical management of the illness or injury suffered by the insured;\n\nii. Does not exceed the level of care necessary to provide safe, adequate, and appropriate medical care in scope, duration, or intensity;\n\niii. Has been prescribed by a medical practitioner; and\n\niv. Conforms to the professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India.\n\nMedicines, drugs, and other allowable consumables prescribed by the treating medical practitioner during hospitalization are covered under in-patient hospitalization expenses.\n\nHowever, treatments classified as \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment,\" including drug experimental therapy \"which is not based on established medical practice in India\" or is \"experimental or unproven,\" are not covered.\n\nTherefore, if the imported medication is considered experimental or unproven treatment (not based on established medical practice in India), the expense will not be covered. The policy requires medical necessity and conformity to accepted medical standards, so coverage depends on whether the imported medication qualifies under these criteria.\n\nSpecific clauses related to this include:\n\n- Definition of \"Unproven/Experimental Treatment\" as treatment not based on established medical practice in India and considered experimental (Clause 43).\n\n- Definition of \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" requiring necessity, appropriate level of care, prescription by a medical practitioner, and conformity to accepted medical standards (Clause 27).\n\n- Coverage of medicines prescribed by the treating medical practitioner as part of inpatient treatment (Clauses III.A.1.F).\n\nIn summary, coverage of expense for an imported medication hinges on it being medically necessary and not experimental or unproven under the policy definitions. Expenses for experimental/unproven treatments are excluded.", "In a non-employer group policy, if a member (policyholder) dies during the policy period, coverage of their dependents may continue until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. Specifically, for Non-Employer\u2013Employee groups, continuation of dependent coverage is \"as specified in the Policy Schedule,\" and dependents may remain covered until policy expiration if this option is chosen. Cover for an insured person or dependent ends immediately upon the death of the insured person unless specifically agreed otherwise to continue coverage until the end of the policy period.\n\nThus, upon death of a member in a non-employer group policy, the dependents' coverage can continue until the policy expires if the insured chooses this option, as per the terms laid out in the Policy Schedule. No mention is made of automatic termination of dependents\u2019 coverage upon the member\u2019s death; continuation is contingent upon the insured\u2019s option and policy terms.\n\nAdditionally, if there is a nominee named, the company pays the nominee or, if none, the legal heirs or representatives of the policyholder. Claims for treatment authorized before policy termination will be paid, but coverage and services end immediately after policy termination (for reasons including death) unless continuation till policy end is specified.\n\nIn summary:\n- Dependents can continue coverage until the policy expiry at the insured\u2019s option.\n- The option and specific terms for continuation are defined in the Policy Schedule.\n- If continuation is not specifically agreed, coverage for dependents ends immediately upon member\u2019s death.\n- The company settles benefits with nominees or legal heirs of the deceased member.", "For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the supporting documentation must include the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries\u2014for example, a stent invoice and sticker in angioplasty surgery. This requirement is explicit: \"Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during Surgeries i.e. lens sticker and Invoice in cataract Surgery, stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty Surgery.\"\n\nIf only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may be affected adversely, as the company explicitly requires implant stickers to validate the use of the implant. Although the text does not describe an automatic denial for missing implant stickers, it states that the insurer may \"decide to deduct the amount of claim for which deficiency is intimated\" and then settle the claim if otherwise valid. This implies that lacking the implant sticker could lead to partial deduction or denial of that portion of the claim.\n\nHence, for implanted device claims, failure to provide the implant sticker alongside the invoice constitutes a deficiency in the necessary documentation that can result in reductions or rejection of the claim amount related to the implant. All claim documents, including bills and invoices, must be in the insured person's name, submitted within prescribed timelines, and accompanied by other medical and hospital documentation as detailed under the claim procedure.", "Home nursing charges after a serious accident and hospitalization qualify for reimbursement under \"post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover\" if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

The post-hospitalisation medical expenses (including home nursing) are incurred following an illness or injury that occurred during the policy period, and relate to the same illness or injury for which hospitalization was claimed.\n\n3. Post-hospitalisation expenses are covered up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance.\n\n4. Private nursing charges or special nursing charges related to post-hospitalisation care are payable.\n\n5. For domiciliary hospitalisation (which may include prolonged home treatment), medical expenses are covered provided the domiciliary hospitalization continues for at least 3 consecutive days.\n\nRegarding documentation required for reimbursement of home nursing charges and related post-hospitalisation expenses:\n\n- Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n\n- Detailed original final hospital bill with break-up along with original deposit and payment receipts.\n\n- All original medicine/pharmacy bills accompanied by attending medical practitioner's prescription.\n\n- All original diagnostic reports (imaging and laboratory) with prescriptions and invoices.\n\n- Medical history and all previous consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for the current ailment.\n\n- Photo ID and age proof, health card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n\n- In cases of accidental injury, a copy of MLC (Medico-Legal Case) or FIR is required.\n\nThese documents must be duly supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner or hospital.\n\nSummary: Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if they are part of accepted post-hospitalisation medical expenses following an approved inpatient hospitalisation claim for the same injury or illness, subject to the policy limits. Adequate documentation including hospital discharge summary, detailed bills, medical prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and legal documents (in accidental cases) must be submitted as per the defined process.", "In a multi-policy scenario where the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the procedure is as follows:\n\n1. The Insured Person may choose to file the claim settlement under any one of their policies; the insurer of that chosen policy is considered the primary insurer.\n\n2. If the coverage available under the chosen (primary) policy is insufficient to cover the entire admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will seek details of the other available policies held by the policyholder.\n\n3. Upon receiving a written request from the Insured Person, the primary insurer shall coordinate with the other insurers to ensure settlement of the balance admissible claim amount as per the respective policy conditions.\n\nRegarding claim settlement coordination and documentation:\n\n- The primary insurer may accept duly certified original documents that were submitted to the other insurer, along with the claim settlement advice certified by that insurer, subject to the company's satisfaction.\n\n- The required documentation includes (but is not limited to):\n\n  * Diagnosis and nature of operation performed with dates, investigation test reports supported by prescriptions from the attending medical practitioner.\n\n  * Medical history, previous consultation papers, bills with detailed break-up, and payment receipts supported by prescription.\n\n  * Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n\n  * Photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, and KYC documents.\n\n  * Original final hospital bill with detailed breakup and payment receipts.\n\n  * Original invoices and payment receipts for implants used during surgeries.\n\n  * All original diagnostic reports with prescriptions and receipts.\n\n  * Original medicine/pharmacy bills with prescriptions.\n\n  * MLC/FIR copy in accidental cases.\n\n  * Copy of death summary and death certificate in death claims.\n\n  * Pre- and post-operative imaging reports.\n\n  * Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.\n\n  * Cheque copy or bank passbook statement as required.\n\nThe claim must be submitted as per the prescribed timelines (within 15 days of discharge for hospitalization reimbursement, for example).\n\nThis process aims to ensure complete settlement of the claim amount by effective coordination among multiple insurers, backed by appropriate documentation and written consent from the Insured Person.", "Expenses incurred for hospitalization primarily for evaluation where all tests and imaging are negative and result in a decision for no treatment are excluded from claim. This is because:\n\n1. \"Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)\" explicitly states that \"Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded.\"\n\n2. Further, \"Any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.\"\n\nSince in the scenario described there is no treatment undertaken after evaluation, the admission is primarily for diagnostic and evaluation purposes, making such expenses non-claimable.\n\nAdditionally, the policy requires that all covered medical expenses be incurred for \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" of the insured person. Absence of treatment following negative tests implies no medically necessary treatment was provided, which also precludes the claim.\n\nTherefore, hospitalization expenses for evaluation alone, without subsequent treatment, are not claimable under this policy.", "If there is a request to change or update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee, and no prior endorsement for nominee change exists, the insurer requires that any change of nomination be communicated to the Company in writing. Such a change becomes effective only when an endorsement is made on the policy. In the event of the policyholder's death, the Company will pay the nominee named in the Policy Schedule, Policy Certificate, or any existing endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment is made to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder, whose discharge from the Company is considered full and final.\n\nAll endorsement requests, including change in nominee details, must be made in writing by the Policyholder and will be assessed by the underwriter; additional information, documents, or premium may be requested. Endorsements become effective from the date the request is received or the date of premium receipt, whichever is later.\n\nTherefore, without a prior endorsement for nominee change, requests to update the nominee after the demise of the previous nominee must be made formally in writing, and will become effective only after the insurer processes and endorses the change.

This is because, under the policy, an AYUSH Day Care Centre or AYUSH hospital must be \"registered with the local authorities, wherever applicable,\" and must meet criteria including having qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners, dedicated therapy sections or equipped operation theatres, and maintaining patient records accessible to the insurance company (Chunk 37). Additionally, \"Hospital\" is defined as an institution \"registered as a hospital with the local authorities\" or complying with minimum criteria (Chunk 42).\n\nReimbursement claims require hospitalisation at a network or registered hospital. Claims from non-network hospitals must be paid upfront and submitted for reimbursement with all necessary original documents within prescribed time limits (Chunk 119). The absence of local registration implies non-compliance with the policy's prerequisite conditions for hospitalisation and claim admissibility (Chunks 37, 42).\n\nTherefore, even if the AYUSH hospital has qualified practitioners, lack of local registration contravenes a \"Condition Precedent,\" meaning the insurer\u2019s liability under the policy is conditional on meeting such terms (Chunk 38). Hence, expenses incurred at an unregistered AYUSH hospital for inpatient mental illness treatment will not be eligible for reimbursement.", "If an insured person requests a cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate, the hospital/provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or the associated TPA before proceeding further. This fresh pre-authorization is required to reflect the change in diagnosis, plan of treatment, or increased cost of treatment during hospitalization. The process for obtaining this fresh authorization must follow the insurer's prescribed procedure for cashless claims as described under clause V.4 or the relevant clause detailed in the policy.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. Upon any change in diagnosis, treatment plan, or increased cost during hospitalization, the network provider must secure a fresh authorization letter from the insurer/TPA according to the authorization process.\n\n2. The treatment must be undertaken within the validity and scope of the pre-authorization; any deviation requires this fresh approval.\n\n3. The insured person is responsible at discharge to verify and sign discharge papers and final bills and must settle any non-medical or inadmissible expenses directly with the hospital.\n\n4. The TPA reserves the right to deny pre-authorization requests if insufficient relevant medical details are provided; however, such denial of pre-authorization is not to be construed as denial of treatment or coverage.\n\nThus, maintaining cashless eligibility when treatment plans change mid-hospitalization mandates that the hospital/provider obtains an updated pre-authorization approval from the insurer/TPA reflecting the revised treatment and cost estimate before continuing treatment under cashless terms.", "If a claim for pre-hospitalization medical expenses is submitted before the approval of the main inpatient hospitalization claim, the pre-hospitalization claim will be processed only after the decision on the main hospitalization claim has been made.

However, claim processing involves the following key steps that could be automated to streamline approval:\n\n1. **Claims Submission and Document Collection:** The insured must submit claims along with treatment documents, invoices, prescriptions, and reports. Documents are electronically collected by the insurer or Third Party Administrator (TPA) for settlement or denial.\n\n2. **Scrutiny and Intimation of Deficiencies:** The TPA or insurer scrutinizes claim forms and documents. Any deficiency in documents is communicated to the insured or network provider, allowing 10 working days to rectify. Up to three reminders are sent.

If the sum insured is exhausted under one policy, claims can be coordinated among multiple policies with primary insurer coordination and possible restoration benefits under certain plans. For legal heir nomination, the policyholder must nominate at inception and may change nomination in writing with insurer endorsement; in absence of nominee, legal heirs receive claims after death.", "For making a cashless psychiatric care request at \"Harmony Wellness\" for a dependent child, immediate notice of claim must be given to the Company/TPA while taking treatment in the Hospital/Nursing Home by fax or e-mail, within 48 hours of admission but before discharge, unless waived in writing (Chunk 94, section 5.18).
