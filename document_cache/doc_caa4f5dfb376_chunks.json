This will\nenable users to navigate immersive virtual\naisles, interact with products, and add items to\ntheir carts in a way that mirrors physical\nshopping, enhancing the sensory appeal of\ndigital retail.

Lastly, VIZARO will explore blockchain\nintegration to address rising concerns about\ntrust and transparency in online commerce.
