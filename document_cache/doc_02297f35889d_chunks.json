THAT  the  PRINCIPIA  of  Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen \nerally  unknown  in  this  country  to  the  present  day  is  a  somewhat \nremarkable  fact ;  because  the  name  of  the  author,  learned  with \nthe  very  elements  of  science,  is  revered  at  every  hearth-stone \nwhere  knowledge  and  virtue  are  of  chief  esteem,  while,  abroad, \nin  all  the  high  places  of  the  land,  the  character  which  that  name \nrecalls  is  held  up  as  the  noblest  illustration  of  what  MAN  may  be, \nand  may  do,  in  the  possession  and  manifestation  of  pre-eminent \nintellectual  and  moral  worth  ;  because  the  work  is  celebrated,  not \nonly  in  the  history  of  one  career  and  one  mind,  but  in  the  history \nof  all  achievement  and  human  reason  itself;  because  of  the  spirit \nof  inquiry,  which  has  been  aroused,  and  which,  in  pursuing  its \nsearchings,  is  not  always  satisfied  with  stopping  short  of  the  foun \ntain-head  of  any  given  truth  ;  and,  finally,  because  of  the  earnest \nendeavour  that  has  been  and  is  constantly  going  on,  in  many \nsections  of  the  Republic,  to  elevate  the  popular  standard  of  edu \ncation  and  give  to  scientific  and  other  efforts  a  higher  and  a \nbetter  aim.", "rd  of  edu \ncation  and  give  to  scientific  and  other  efforts  a  higher  and  a \nbetter  aim.

Great  genius  is  seldom  marked  by  precocious  development ; \nand  young  Isaac,  sent,  at  the  usual  age,  to  two  day  schools  at \nSkillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character. In  his  twelfth  year,  he  was  placed  at  the  public  school  at  Gran- \ntham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of  Mr. Clark,  an  apothecary. But  even  in  this  excellent  seminary,  his  mental  acquisitions  con \ntinued  for  a  while  unpromising  enough  :  study  apparentlv  had  no \ncharms  for  him ;  he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the \nschool.

To  him,  however,  young  as  he  was,  life  seemed \nto  have  become  an  earnest  thing. When  not  occupied  with  his \nstudies,  his  mind  would  be  engrossed  with  mechanical  contrivances ; \nnow  imitating,  now  inventing.

Not  content,  however,  with  this  exact  imitation,  he \nconceived  the  idea  of  employing,  in  the  place  of  sails,  animal  power  , \nand,  adapting  the  construction  of  his  mill  accordingly,  he  enclosed \nin  it  a  mouse,  called  the  miller,  and  which  by  acting  on  a  sort  ot \ntreadvvheel,  gave  motion  to  the  machine.

In  1656,  Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took \nup  her  abode  once  more  at  Woolsthorpe. He  was  now  fifteen \nyears  of  age,  and  had  made  great  progress  in  his  studies  ;  but  she, \ndesirous  of  his  help,  and  from  motives  of  economy,  recalled  him \nfrom  school. Business  occupations,  however,  and  the  manage \nment  of  the  farm,  proved  utterly  distasteful  to  him.

The  more  immediate  affairs  of  the  farm  received  no \nbetter  attention. In  fact,  his  passion  for  study  grew  daily  more \nabsorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in \ntense. His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to  give  him  all  the \nadvantages  which  an  education  could  confer.

At  this  period,  the  most  distinguished  philosophers  were  direct \ning  all  their  energies  to  the  subject  of  light  and  the  improvement \nof  the  refracting  telescope. Newton,  having  applied  himself  to \nthe  grinding  of  \"optic  glasses  of  other  figures  than  spherical,\"  ex \nperienced  the  impracticability  of  executing  such  lenses  ;  and  con \njectured  that  their  defects,  and  consequently  those  of  refracting \ntelescopes,  might  arise  from  some  other  cause  than  the  imperfect \nconvergency  of  rays  to  a  single  point.

This \nprofound  and  beautiful  discovery  opened  up  a  new  era  in  the \nHistory  of  Optics. As  bearing,  however,  directly  upon  the  construc \ntion  of  telescopes,  he  saw  that  a  lens  refracting  exactly  like  a  prism \nwould  necessarily  bring  the  different  rays  to  different  foci,  at \ndifferent  distances  from  the  glass,  confusing  and  rendering  the \nvision  indistinct. Taking  for  granted  that  all  bodies  produced \nspectra  of  ^  jtial  length,  he  dismissed  all  further  consideration  of \nthe  refracting  instrument,  and  took  up  the  principle  of  reflection. Rays  of  all  colours,  he  found,  were  reflected  regularly,  so  that  the \nangle  of  reflection  was  equal  to  the  angle  of  incidence,  and  hence \nhe  concluded  that  ojitical  instruments  might  be  brought  to  any \ndegree  of  perfection  imaginable,  provided  reflecting  specula  of \nthe  requisite  figure  and  finish  could  be  obtained.

Towards  the  close  of  a  pleasant  day  in  the  early  autumn  of \n1666,  he  was  seated  alone  beneath  a  tree,  in  his  garden,  absorbed \nin  meditation. He  was  a  slight  young  man  ;  in  the  twenty-fourth \nyear  of  his  age  ;  his  countenance  mild  and  full  of  thought. For \na  century  previous,  the  science  of  Astronomy  had  advanced  with \nrapid  strides. The  human  mind  had  risen  from  the  gloom  and \nbondage  of  the  middle  ages,  in  unparalleled  vigour,  to  unfold  the \nsystem,  to  investigate  the  phenomena,  and  to  establish  the  laws \nof  the  heavenly  bodies.

The  nature  of  gravity \u2014 that  mysterious  power  which  causes \nall  bodies  to  descend  towards  the  centre  of  the  earth \u2014 had,  in \ndeed,  dawned  upon  him.

In  forming  this  conclusion,  he  supposed  the \nplanets  to  move  in  perfect  circles,  concentric  to  the  sun. Now \nwas  this  the  law  of  the  moon's  motion  ?

The  result  of  his  calculations  did  not,  ot  course,  answer  his  ex \npectations  ;  hence,  he  concluded  that  some  other  cause,  beyond  the \nreach  of  observation \u2014 analogous,  perhaps,  to  the  vortices  of  Des \ncartes \u2014 joined  its  action  to  that  of  the  power  of  gravity  upon  the \nrnooil.

On  his  return  to  Cambridge,  in  1668,  he  resumed  his  optical \nlabours.

Dr. Barrow,  having  resolved  to  devote  himself  to  Theology, \nresigned  the  Lucasian  Professorship  of  Mathematics,  in  1669,  in \nfavour  of  Newton,  who  accordingly  received  the  appointment  to \nthe  vacant  chair. During  the  years  1669,  1670,  and  1671,  our  author,  as  such \nProfessor,  delivered  a  course  of  Optical  Lectures. Though  these \ncontained  his  principal  discoveries  relative  to  the  different  re- \nfrangibility  of  light,  yet  the  discoveries  themselves  did  not  be \ncome  publicly  known,  it  seems,  till  he  communicated  them  to  the \nRoyal  Society,  a  few  weeks  after  being  elected  a  member  there \nof,  in  the  spring  of  1671-2. He  now  rose  rapidly  in  reputation, \nand  was  soon  regarded  as  foremost  among  the  philosophers  of  the \nage. His  paper  on  light  excited  the  deepest  interest  in  the  Royal \nSociety,  who  manifested  an  anxious  solicitude  to  secure  the  author \nfrom  the  \"  arrogations  of  others,\"  and  proposed  to  publish  his \ndiscourse  in  the  monthly  numbers  in  which  the  Transactions  were \ngiven  to  the  world.", "is \ndiscourse  in  the  monthly  numbers  in  which  the  Transactions  were \ngiven  to  the  world. Newton,  gratefully  sensible  of  these  expres \nsions  of  esteem,  willingly  accepted  of  the  proposal  for  publication. He  gave  them  also,  at  this  time,  the  results  of  some  further  ex \nperiments  in  the  decomposition  and  re-composition  of  light : \u2014 that \nthe  same  degree  of  refrangibility  always  belonged  to  the  same \ncolour,  and  the  same  colour  to  the  same  degree  of  refrangibility : \nthat  the  seven  different  colours  of  the  spectrum  were  original,  or \nsimple,  and  that  whiteness^  or  white  light  was  a  compound  of  all \nthese  seven  colours.

He  also  contemplated,  about  the  same  time,  an  edition  of  Kirick- \nhuysen's  Algebra,  with  notes  and  additions;  partially  arranging, \nas  an  introduction  to  the  work,  a  treatise,  entitled,  A  Method  of \nFluxions ;  but  he  finally  abandoned  the  design. This  treatise, \nhowever,  he  resolved,  or  rather  consented,  at  a  late  period  of  his \nlife,  to  put  forth  separately  ;  and  the  plan  would  probably  have \nbeen  carried  into  execution  had  riot  his  death  intervened. It  was \ntranslated  into  English,  and  published  in  1736  by  John  Colson, \nProfessor  of  Mathematics  in  Cambridge. Newton,  it  is  thought,  made  his  discoveries  concerning  the \nINFLECTION  and  DIFFRACTION  of  light  before  1674. The  phe \nnomena  of  the  inflection  of  light  had  been  first  discovered  more \nthan  ten  years  before  by  Grimaldi.", "inflection  of  light  had  been  first  discovered  more \nthan  ten  years  before  by  Grimaldi. And  Newton  began  by  re \npeating  one  of  the  experiments  of  the  learned  Jesuit \u2014 admitting \na  beam  of  the  sun's  light  through  a  small  pin  hole  into  a  dark \nchamber :  the  light  diverged  from  the  aperture  in  the  form  of  a, \ncone,  and  the  shadows  of  all  bodies  placed  in  this  light  were \nlarger  than  might  have  been  expected,  and  surrounded  with  three \ncoloured  fringes,  the  nearest  being  widest,  and  the  most  remote \nthe  narrowest. Newton,  advancing  upon  this  experiment,  took \nexact  measures  of  the  diameter  of  the  shadow  of  a  human  hair, \nand  of  the  breadth  of  the  fringes,  at  different  distances  behind  it, \nand  discovered  that  these  diameters  and  breadths  were  not  pro \nportional  to  the  distances  at  which  they  were  measured. He \nhence  supposed  that  the  rays  which  passed  by  the  edge  of  the \nhair  were  deflected  or  turned  aside  from  it,  as  if  by  a  repulsive \nforce,  the  nearest  rays  suffering  the  greatest,  the  more  remote  a \nless  degree  of  deflection.", "the  nearest  rays  suffering  the  greatest,  the  more  remote  a \nless  degree  of  deflection.

His  inquiries  on  this  subject  were  here  interrupted \nand  fiever  renewed. His  Theory  of  the  COLOURS  of  NATURAL  BODIES  was  commu \nnicated  to  the  Royal  Society,  in  February,  1675. This  is  justly \nregarded  as  one  of  the  profoundest  of  his  speculations. The  fun \ndamental  principles  of  the  Theory  in  brief,  are : \u2014 That  bodies \npossessing  the  greatest  refractive  powers  reflect  the  greatest \nquantity  of  light ;  and  that,  at  the  confines  of  equally  refracting \nmedia,  there  is  no  reflection. That  the  minutest  particles  of  al \nmost  all  natural  bodies  are  in  some  degree  transparent. That \nbetween  the  particles  of  bodies  there  are  pores,  or  spaces,  either \nempty  or  filled  with  media  of  a  less  density  than  the  particles \nthemselves. That  these  particles,  and  pores  or  spaces,  have  some \ndefinite  size. Hence  he  deduced  the  Transparency,  Opacity,  and \ncolours  of  natural  bodies.", "definite  size. Hence  he  deduced  the  Transparency,  Opacity,  and \ncolours  of  natural  bodies. Transparency  arises  from  the  particles \nand  their  pores  being  too  small  to  cause  reflection  at  their  com \nmon  surfaces \u2014 the  light  all  passing  through  ;  Opacity  from  the \nopposite  cause  of  the  particles  and  their  pores  being  sufficiently \nlarge  to  reflect  the  light  which  is  \"  stopped  or  stifled7'  by  the \nmultitude  of  reflections ;  and  colours  from  the  particles,  accord \ning  to  their  several  sizes,  reflecting  rays  of  one  colour  and  trans \nmitting  those  of  another \u2014 or  in  other  words,  the  colour  that \nmeets  the  eye  is  the  colour  reflected,  while  all  the  other  rays  are \ntransmitted  or  absorbed. Analogous  in  origin  to  the  colours  of  natural  bodies,  he  con \nsidered  the  COLOURS  OF  THIN  PLATES. This  subject  was  interest \ning  and  important,  and  had  attracted  considerable  investigation. He,  however,  was  the  first  to  determine  the  law  of  the  produc \ntion  of  these  colours,  arid,  during  the  same  year  made  known  the \nresults  of  his  researches  herein  to  the  Royal  Society.

Thus,  from", "UFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 25 \ntheir  point  of  contact  at  the  centre,  to  the  circumference  of  the \nlens,  he  obtained  plates  of  air,  or  spaces  varying  from  the  ex- \ntremest  possible  thinness,  by  slow  degrees,  to  a  considerable  thick \nness. Letting  the  light  fall,  every  different  thickness  of  this \nplate  of  air  gave  different  colours \u2014 the  point  of  contact  of  the \nlens  and  glass  forming  the  centre  of  numerous  concentric  colored \nnags. Now  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the  lens  being  known,  the \nthickness  of  the  plate  of  air,  at  any  given  point,  or  where  any  par \nticular  colour  appeared,  could  be  exactly  determined. Carefully \nnoting,  therefore,  the  order  in  which  the  different  colours  ap \npeared,  he  measured,  with  the  nicest  accuracy,  the  different  thick* \nnesses  at  which  the  most  luminous  parts  of  the  rings  were  pro \nduced,  whether  the  medium  were  air,  water,  or  mica \u2014 all  these \nsubstances  giving  the  same  colours  at  different  thicknesses ; \u2014 the \nratio  of  which  he  also  ascertained.

By  this \nTheory  of  Fits,  our  author  likewise  explained  the  colours  of \nthick  plates. He  regarded  light  as  consisting  of  small  material  particles \nemitted  from  shining  substances. He  thought  that  these  parti \ncles  could  be  re-combined  into  solid  matter,  so  that  \"  gross  bodies \nand  light,  were  convertible  into  one  another  ;\"  that  the  particles  of \nlight  and  the  particles  of  solid  bodies  acted  mutually  upon  each \nother ;  those  of  light  agitating  and  heating  those  of  solid  bodies, \nand  the  latter  attracting  and  repelling  the  former.

One  of  the  most  curious  of  Newton's  minor  inquiries  related  to \nthe  connexion  between  the  refractive  powers  and  chemical  com \nposition  of  bodies.

This  I  re \npeated  a  second  and  a  third  time. At  the  third  time,  when  the \nphantasm  of  light  and  colours  about  it  were  almost  vanished,  in \ntending  my  fancy  upon  them  to  see  their  last  appearance,  I  found, \nto  my  amazement,  that  they  began  to  return,  and  by  little  and \nlittle  to  become  as  lively  and  vivid  as  when  I  had  newly  looked \nupon  the  sun. But  when  I  ceased  to  intend  my  fancy  upon  them, \nthey  vanished  again.", "ed \nupon  the  sun. But  when  I  ceased  to  intend  my  fancy  upon  them, \nthey  vanished  again.

And,  at  length,  by  repeating  this,  without \nlooking  any  more  upon  the  sun,  I  made  such  an  impression  on  my \neye,  that,  if  I  looked  upon  the  clouds,  or  a  book,  or  any  bright \nobject,  I  saw  upon  it  a  round  bright  spot  of  light  like  the  sun, \nand,  which  is  still  stranger,  though  I  looked  upon  the  sun  with \nmy  right  eye  only,  and  not  with  my  left,  yet  my  fancy  began  *o \nmake  an  impression  upon  my  left  eye,  as  well  us  upon  my  right.", "et  my  fancy  began  *o \nmake  an  impression  upon  my  left  eye,  as  well  us  upon  my  right.

To  place  this  effect  in  a  constant \nmotion  is  hard,  because  the  sun  ought  then  to  appear  perpetually.

The  idea  of  Universal  Gravitation,  first  caught  sight  of,  so \nto  speak,  in  the  garden  at  Woolsthorpe,  years  ago,  had  gradually \nexpanded  upon  him. We  find  him,  in  a  letter  to  Dr. Hooke, \nSecretary  of  the  Royal  Society,  dated  in  November,  1679,  pro \nposing  to  verify  the  motion  of  the  earth  by  direct  experiment, \nnamely,  by  the  observation  of  the  path  pursued  by  a  body  falling \nfrom  a  considerable  height.

When  he  was  attending  a  meeting  of  the  Royal  Society,  in \nJune  1682,  the  conversation  fell  upon  the  subject  of  the  measure \nment  of  a  degree  of  the  meridian,  executed  by  M. Picard,  a \nFrench  Astronomer,  in  1679. Newton  took  a  memorandum  oi \nthe  result ;  and  afterward,  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  computed \nfrom  it  the  diameter  of  the  earth  :  furnished  with  these  new  data, \nhe  resumed  his  calculation  of  1666.

And  so  his  GREAT  THOUGHT,  that  had  for  sixteen \nyears  loomed  up  in  dim,  gigantic  outline,  amid  the  first  dawn  of  a \nplausible  hypothesis,  now  stood  forth,  radiant  and  not  less  grand, \nin  the  mid-day  light  of  demonstrated  truth. It  were  difficult,  nay  impossible  to  imagine,  even,  the  influence \nof  a  result  like  this  upon  a  mind  like  Newton's.

At  or  near  this  pe \nriod,  other  philosophers,  as  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  Dr. Halley, \nand  Dr. Hooke,  were  engaged  in  investigating  the  same  subject ; \nbut  with  no  definite  or  satisfactory  results. Dr. Halley,  having \nseen,  it  is  presumed,  our  author's  propositions,  went  in  August, \n1684,  to  Cambridge  to  consult  with  him  upon  the  subject. Newton  assured  him  that  he  had  brought  the  demonstration  to \nperfection. In  November,  Dr. Halley  received  a  copy  of  the \nwork  ;  and,  in  the  following  month^  announced  . it  to  the  Royal \nSociety,  with  the  author's  promise  to  have  it  entered  upon  their \nRegister.

The  prominent \npart  which  our  author  took  in  these  proceedings,  and  his  eminence \nin  the  scientific  world,  induced  his  proposal  as  one  of  the  parlia \nmentary  representatives  of  the  University. He  was  elected,  in \n1688,  and  sat  in  the  Convention  Parliament  till  its  dissolution. After  the  first  year,  however,  he  seems  to  have  given  little  or  no \nattention  to  his  parliamentary  duties,  being  seldom  absent  from \nthe  University  till  his  appointment  in  the  Mint,  in  1695.

But  M.

As  to  the  accident  itself,  we  may  suppose,  whatever  might  have \nbeen  its  precise  nature,  that  it  greatly  distressed  him,  and,  still \nfurther,  that  its  shock  may  have  originated  the  train  of  nervous \nderangements,  which  afflicted  him,  more  or  less,  for  two  years \nafterward. Yet,  during  this  very  period  of  ill  health,  we  find  him \nputting  forth  his  highest  powers.

But  he  had,  on  receiving  the  appointment  of  Master  of  the  Mint, \nin  1699,  made  Mr. Whiston  his  deputy,  with  all  the  emoluments \nof  the  office  ;  and,  on  finally  resigning,  procured  his  nomination  to \nthe  vacant  Chair. In  January  1697,  John  Bernouilli  proposed  to  the  most  distin \nguished  mathematicians  of  Europe  two  problems  for  solution. Leibnitz,  admiring  the  beauty  of  one  of  them,  requested  the  time \nfor  solving  it  to  be  extended  to  twelve  months \u2014 twice  the  period \noriginally  named. The  delay  was  readily  granted. Newton,  how \never,  sent  in,  the  day  after  he  received  the  problems,  a  solution  of \nthem  to  the  President  of  the  Royal  Society. Bernouilli  obtained \nsolutions  from  Newton,  Leibinitz  and  the  Marquis  De  L'Hopital ; \nbut  Newton's  though  anonymous,  he  immediately  recognised \n\" tanquam  ungue  leonem\"  as  the  lion  is  known  by  his  claw. We  may  mention  here  the  famous  problem  of  the  trajectories \nproposed  by  Leibnitz,  in  1716,  for  the  purpose  of  \"feeling  the \npulse  of  the  English  Analysts.\"  Newton  received  the  problem \nabout  five  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  as  he  was  returning  from  the", "LIFE    OF    SIR    ISAAC    NEWTON. 45 \nMint ;  and  though  it  was  extremely  difficult  and  he  himself  much \nfatigued,  yet  he  completed  its  solution,  the  same  evening  before \nhe  went  to  bed. The  history  of  these  problems  affords,  by  direct  comparison,  a \nstriking  illustration  of  Newton's  vast  superiority  of  mind. That \namazing  concentration  and  grasp  of  intellect,  of  which  we  have \nspoken,  enabled  him  to  master  speedily,  and,  as  it  were,  by  a \nsingle  effort,  those  things,  for  the  achievement  of  which,  the  many \nwould  essay  utterly  in  vain,  and  the  very,  very  few  attain  only \nafter  long  and  renewed  striving. And  yet,  with  a  modesty  as \nunparalleled  as  his  power,  he  attributed  his  successes,  not  to  any \nextraordinary  sagacity,  but  solely  to  industry  and  patient  thought. Mr-  kept  the  subject  of  consideration  constantly  before  him,  and \nwaited  till  the  first  dawning  opened  gradually  into  a  full  and \nclear  light ;  never  quitting,  if  possible,  the  mental  process  till  the \nobject  of  it  were  wholly  gained. He  never  allowed  this  habit  of \nmeditation  to  appear  in  his  intercourse  with  society ;  but  in  the \nprivacy  of  his  own  chamber,  or  in  the  midst  of  his  own  family,  he \ngave  himself  up  to  the  deepest  abstraction.", "r,  or  in  the  midst  of  his  own  family,  he \ngave  himself  up  to  the  deepest  abstraction. Occupied  with  some \ninteresting  investigation,  he  would  often  sit  down  on  his  bedside, \nafter  he  rose,  and  remain  there,  for  hours,  partially  dressed. Meal-time  would  frequently  come  and  pass  unheeded ;  so  that, \nunless  urgently  reminded,  he  would  neglect  to  take  the  re \nquisite  quantity  of  nourishment. But  notwithstanding  his  anx \niety  to  be  left  undisturbed,  he  would,  when  occasion  required, \nturn  aside  his  thoughts,  though  bent  upon  the  most  intricate  re \nsearch,  and  then,  when  leisure  served,  again  direct  them  to  the \nvery  point  where  they  ceased  to  act :  and  this  he  seemed  to  ac \ncomplish  not  so  much  by  the  force  of  his  memory,  as  by  the  force \nof  his  inventive  faculty,  before  the  vigorous  intensity  of  which,  no \nsubject,  however  abstruse,  remained  long  unexplored.

The  instrument  was  the  same  as  that \nproduced  by  Mr. Hadley,  in  1731,  and  which,  under  the  name  of \nHadley's  Quadrant,  has  been  of  so  great  use  in  navigation. On \nthe  assembling  of  the  new  Parliament,  in  1701,  Newton  was  re- \nelected  one  of  the  members  for  the  University  of  Cambridge. In \n1703,  he  was  chosen  President  of  the  Royal  Society  of  London, \nto  which  office  he  was  annually  re-elected  till  the  period  of  his \ndecease \u2014 about  twenty-five  years  afterward. Our  author  unquestionably  devoted  more  labour  to,  and,  in \nmany  respects,  took  a  greater  pride  in  his  Optical,  than  his  other \ndiscoveries. This  science  he  had  placed  on  a  new  and  indestruc \ntible  basis ;  and  he  wished  not  only  to  build,  but  to  perfect  the \ncostly  and  glowing  structure. He  had  communicated,  before  the \npublication  of  the  PRINCIPIA,  his  most  important  researches  on \nlight  to  the  Royal  Society,  in  detached  papers  which  were  inserted \nin  successive  numbers  of  the  Transactions ;  but  he  did  not  pub \nlish  a  connected  view  of  these  labours  till  1704,  when  they  appeared \nunder  the  title  of  OPTICS  :  OR,  A  TREATISE  ON  THE  REFLEXIONS, \nREFRACTIONS,  INFLEXIONS  AND  COLOURS  OF  LIGHT.", "PTICS  :  OR,  A  TREATISE  ON  THE  REFLEXIONS, \nREFRACTIONS,  INFLEXIONS  AND  COLOURS  OF  LIGHT. To  this, \nbut  to  no  subsequent  edition,  were  added  two  Mathematical  Trea \ntises,  entitled,  TRACTATUS  DUO  DE  SPECIEBUS  ET  MAGNITUDINE \nFIGURARUM  cuRViLiNEARUM ;  the  one  bearing  the  title  TRACTATUS \nDE  QUADRATURA  CuRVARUM ;  and  the  other,  that  of  ENUMERATIO \nLINEARUM  TERTII  ORDiNis. The  publication  of  these  Mathemati \ncal  Treatises  was  made  necessary  in  consequence  of  plagiarisms \nfrom  the  manuscripts  of  them  loaned  by  the  author  to  his  friends. Dr. Samuel  Clarke  published  a  Latin  translation  of  the  Optics,  in \nin  1706  ;  whereupon  he  was  presented  by  Newton,  as  a  mark  of \nhis  grateful  approbation,  with  five  hundred  pounds,  or  one  hun \ndred  pounds  for  each  of  his  children. The  work  was  afterward \ntranslated  into  French. It  had  a  remarkably  wide  circulation, \nand  appeared,  in  several  successive  editions,  both  in  England  and \non  the  Continent.

Soon  afterward,  he  was  a  candidate  again  for  the  Repre \nsentation  of  the  University,  but  was  defeated  by  a  large  majority. It  is  thought  that  a  more  pliant  man  was  preferred  by  both  min \nisters  and  electors. Newton  was  always  remarkable  for  simplicity \nof  dress,  and  his  only  known  departure  from  it  was  on  this  oc \ncasion,  when  he  is  said  to  have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced \nclothes. The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had,  Juring  nine  years, \ndelivered  at  Cambridge,  were  published  by  Whiston,  in  1707, \nunder  the  title  of  ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI \nTIONS  ET  RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER. This  publication \nis  said  to  have  been  a  breach  of  confidence  on  Whiston's  part. Mr. Ralphson,  not  long  afterward,  translated  the  work  into  English ; \nand  a  second  edition  of  it,  with  improvements  by  the  author,  was \nissued  at  London,  1712,  by  Dr. Machin.

Subsequent  editions, \nboth  in  English  and  Latin,  with  commentaries,  have  been  published. In  June,  1709,  Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a \nsecond  edition  of  the  PRINCIPIA  to  Roger  Cotes,  Plumian  Pro \nfessor  of  Astronomy  at  Cambridge. The  first  edition  had  been \nsold  off  for  some  time. Copies  of  the  work  had  become  very \nrare,  and  could  only  be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original \ncost. A  great  number  of  letters  passed  oetween  the  author  and \nMr. Cotes  during  the  preparation  of  the  edition,  which  finally \nappeared  in  May,  1713. It  had  many  alterations  and  improve \nments,  and  was  accompanied  by  an  admirable  Preface  from  the \npen  of  Cotes. Our  author's  early  Treatise,  entitled,  ANALYSIS  PER  EQUATIONES \nNUMERO  TERMINORUM  INFINITAS,  as  well  as  a  small  Tract,  Gearing \nthe  title  of  METHODUS  DIFFERENTIALS,  was  published,  witn  nis \nconsent,  in  1711.

It  is  a  notable  fact,  in  Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun* \ntarily  published  any  one  of  his  purely  mathematical  writings \nThe  cause  of  this  unwillingness  in  some,  and,  in  other  instances, \nof  his  indifference,  or,  at  least,  want  of  solicitude  to  put  forth  his \nworks  may  be  confidently  sought  for  in  his  repugnance  to  every \nthing  like  contest  or  dispute. But,  going  deeper  than  this  aver \nsion,  we  find,  underlying  his  whole  character  and  running  parallel \nwith  all  his  discoveries,  that  extraordinary  humility  which  always \npreserved  him  in  a  position  so  relatively  just  to  the  behests  of \ntime  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite  value  of  truth,  and  the  utter \nworthlessness  of  fame,  were  alike  constantly  present  to  him. Judging  of  his  course,  however,  in  its  more  temporary  aspect,  as \nbearing  upon  his  immediate  quiet,  it  seemed  the  most  unfortunate.

The  conduct  of  Leibnitz  in  this  affair  is  quite  irreconcilable \nwith  the  stature  and  strength  of  the  man ;  giant-like,  and  doing \nnobly,  in  many  ways,  a  giant's  work,  yet  cringing  himself  into  the \ndimensions  and  performances  of  a  common  calumniator.

That  when  Mr. Leibnitz  was  the  first  time  in  London, \nhe  contended  for  the  invention  of  another  differential  method, \nproperly  so  called  ;  and,  notwithstanding  he  was  shown  by  Dr. Pell  that  it  was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in  maintaining  it  to \nbe  his  own  invention,  by  reason  that  he  had  found  it  by  himself \nwithout  knowing  what  Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much \nimproved  it.

He  succeeded,  however,  by  means  of  a  strict  regimen, \nand  other  precautions,  in  alleviating  his  complaint,  and  procuring \nlong  intervals  of  ease.

He  gave  up  the  use  of  his \ncarriage,  and  employed,  in  its  stead,  when  he  went  out,  a  chair. All  invitations  to  dinner  were  declined ;  and  only  small  parties \nwere  received,  occasionally,  at  his  own  house. In  1724  he  wrote  to  the  Lord  Provost  of  Edinburgh,  offering \nto  contribute  twenty  pounds  yearly  toward  the  salary  of  Mr. Maclaurin,  provided  he  accepted  the  assistant  Professorship  of \nMathematics  in  the  University  of  that  place.

He  was  generous  and  charitable  almost  to  a  fault. Those,  he  would  often  remark,  who  gave  away  nothing  till  they \ndied,  never  gave  at  all. His  wealth  had  become  considerable  by \na  prudent  economy ;  but  he  regarded  money  in  no  other  light \nthan  as  one  of  the  means  wherewith  he  had  been  intrusted  to  do \ngood,  and  he  faithfully  employed  it  accordingly.

Mr. Conduit,  his  nephew,  has  recorded  a  curious  conversation  which \ntook  place,  at  or  near  this  time,  between  himself  and  Sir  Isaac. \"I  was,  on  Sunday  night,  the  7th  March,  1724-5,  at  Kensing \nton,  with  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  in  his  lodgings,  just  after  he  was  out \nof  a  fit  of  the  gout,  which  he  had  had  in  both  of  his  feet,  for  the \nfirst  time,  in  the  eighty-third  year  of  his  age.

This  answer  called  into  the  field  a  fresh  antagonist,  Father  Soueiet, \nwhose  five  dissertations  on  this  subject  were  chiefly  remarkable \nfor  the  want  of  knowledge  and  want  of  decorum,  which  they \ndisplayed. In  consequence  of  these  discussions,  Newton  was  in \nduced  to  prepare  his  larger  work  for  the  press,  and  had  nearly \ncompleted  it  at  the  time  of  his  death.

He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of  any \nmathematical  writer  of  modern  times,  and  the  most  just  imitator \nof  the  ancients. Of  their  taste  and  form  of  demonstration,  Sir \nIsaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer. I  have  heard \nhim  even  censure  himself  for  not  following  them  yet  more  closely \nthan  he  did  ;  and  speak  with  regret  of  his  mistake  at  the  begin \nning  of  his  mathematical  studies,  in  applying  himself  to  the  works \nof  Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he  had  considered \nthe  elements  of  Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a \nwriter  deserves.\" \n\"  Though  his  memory  was  much  decayed,\"  continues  Dr.", "so  excellent  a \nwriter  deserves.\" \n\"  Though  his  memory  was  much  decayed,\"  continues  Dr. Pem- \nberton,  \"he  perfectly  understood  his  own  writings.\"  And  even \nthis  failure  of  memory,  we  would  suggest,  might  have  been  more \napparent  than  real,  or,  in  medical  terms,  more  the  result  of  func \ntional  weakness  than  organic  decay. Newton  seems  never  to \nhave  confided  largely  to  his  memory :  and  as  this  faculty  mani \nfests  the  most  susceptibility  to  cultivation  ;  so,  in  the  neglect  of \ndue  exercise,  it  more  readily  and  plainly  shows  a  diminution  of \nits  powers. Equanimity  and  temperance  had,  indeed,  preserved  Newton \nsingularly  free  from  all  mental  and  bodily  ailment. His  hair  was, \nto  the  last,  quite  thick,  though  as  white  as  silver. He  never \nmade  use  of  spectacles,  and  lost  but  one  tooth  to  the  day  of  his \ndeath.

When  he  rode \nin  his  coach,  one  arm  would  be  out  of  his  coach  on  one  side  and \nthe  other  on  the  other.\"  These  different  accounts  we  deem \neasily  reconcilable.

His  body  was  placed  in  Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state \nand  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of  the  most \ndistinguished.

Therefore  geometry  is  founded  in  mechanical  practice,  and  is \nnothing  but  that  part  of  universal  mechanics  which  accurately  proposes \nand  demonstrates  the  art  of  measuring.

A  body,  from  the  inactivity  of  matter,  is  not  without  difficulty  put  out \nof  its  state  of  rest  or  motion. Upon  which  account,  this  vis  insita,  may, \nby  a  most  significant  name,  be  called  vis  inertia,  or  force  of  inactivity. Hut  a  body  exerts  this  force  only,  when  another  force,  impressed  upon  it, \nendeavours  to  change  its  condition ;  and  the  exercise  of  this  force  may  bo \nconsidered  both  as  resistance  and  impulse ;  it  is  resistance,  in  so  far  as  the \nbody,  for  maintaining  its  present  state,  withstands  the  force  impressed;  it \nis  impulse,  in  so  far  as  the  body,  by  not  easily  giving  way  to  the  impressed \nforce  of  another,  endeavours  to  change  the  state  of  that  other. Resistance \nis  usually  ascribed  to  bodies  at  rest,  and  impulse  to  those  in  motion; \nbut  motion  and  rest,  as  commonly  conceived,  are  only  relatively  distin \nguished  ;  nor  are  those  bodies  always  truly  at  rest,  which  commonly  are \ntaken  to  be  so.

And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  all  bodies,  revolved  in \nany  orbits. They  all  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  centres  of  their  orbits ; \nand  wore  it  not  for  the  opposition  of  a  contrary  force  which  restrains  them \nto,  and  detains  them  in  their  orbits,  which  I  therefore  call  centripetal,  would \ntiy  off  in  right  lines,  with  an  uniform  motion.

It  is  by  its  gravity  that  it  is  drawn \naside  perpetually  from  its  rectilinear  course,  and  made  to  deviate  towards \nthe  earth,  more  or  less,  according  to  the  force  of  its  gravity,  and  the  velo \ncity  of  its  motion. The  less  its  gravity  is,  for  the  quantity  of  its  matter, \nor  the  greater  the  velocity  with  which  it  is  projected,  the  less  will  it  devi \nate  from  a  rectilinear  course,  and  the  farther  it  will  go.

And  by  increasing  the  velo \ncity,  we  may  at  pleasure  increase  the  distance  to  which  it  might  be  pro \njected,  and  diminish  the  curvature  of  the  line,  which  it  might  describe,  till \nat  last  it  should  fall  at  the  distance  of  10,  30,  or  90  degrees,  or  even  might \ngo  quite  round  the  whole  earth  before  it  falls ;  or  lastly,  so  that  it  might \nnever  fall  to  the  earth,  but  go  forward  into  the  celestial  spaces,  and  pro \nceed  in  its  motion  in  iiifiuitum.

If  this  force  was  too  small, \nit  would  not  sufficiently  turn  the  moon  out  of  a  rectilinear  course :  if  it \nwas  too  great,  it  would  turn  it  too  much,  arid  draw  down  the  moon  from \nits  orbit  towards  the  earth. It  is  necessary,  that  the  force  be  of  a  just \nquantity,  and  it  belongs  to  the  mathematicians  to  find  the  force,  that  may \nserve  exactly  to  retain  a  body  in  a  given  orbit,  with  a  given  velocity ;  and \nvice  versa,  to  determine  the  curvilinear  way,  into  which  a  body  projected \nfrom  a  given  place,  with  a  given  velocity,  may  be  made  to  deviate  from \nits  natural  rectilinear  way,  by  means  of  a  given  force.

This  sort  of  quantity  is  the  centripetency,  or  propension  of  the \nwhole  body  towards  the  centre,  or,  as  I  may  say,  its  weight ;  and  it  is  al \nways  known  by  the  quantity  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient \nto  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body.", "ty  of  an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient \nto  Ifinder  the  descent  of  the  body. These  quantities  of  forces,  we  may,  for  brevity's  sake,  call  by  the  names \nof  motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ;  and,  for  distinction's  sake,  con \nsider  them,  with  respect  to  the  bodies  that  tend  to  the  centre ;  to  the  places \nof  those  bodies ;  and  to  the  centre  of  force  towards  which  they  tend  ;  that \nis  to  say,  I  refer  the  motive  force  to  the  body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen \nsity  of  the  whole  towards  a  centre,  arising  from  the  propensities  of  the \nseveral  parts  taken  together ;  the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the \nbody,  as  a  certain  power  or  energy  diffused  from  the  centre  to  all  places \naround  to  move  the  bodies  that  are  in  them :  and  the  absolute  force  to \nthe  centre,  as  endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces \nwould  not  be  propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about ;  whether  that \ncause  be  some  central  body  (siuh  as  is  the  load-stone,  in  the  centre  of  the \nmagnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or \nanything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear.", "h  in  the  centre  of  the  gravitating  force),  or \nanything  else  that  does  not  yet  appear. For  I  here  design  only  to  give  a \nmathematical  notion  of  those  forces,  without  considering  their  physical \ncauses  and  seats. Wherefore  the  accelerative  force  will  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the \nmotive,  as  celerity  does  to  motion. For  the  quantity  of  motion  arises  from \nthe  celerity  drawn  into  the  quantity  of  matter :  and  the  motive  force  arises \nfrom  the  accelerative  force  drawn  into  the  same  quantity  of  matter. For \nthe  sum  of  the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force,  upon  the  several  ;  articles \nof  the  body,  is  the  motive  force  of  the  whole. Hence  it  is,  that  near  the", "OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 77 \nsurface  of  the  earth,  where  the  accelerative  gravity,  or  force  productive  of \ngravity,  in  all  bodies  is  the  same,  the  motive  gravity  or  the  weight  is  as \nthe  body :  but  if  we  should  ascend  to  higher  regions,  where  the  accelerative \ngravity  is  less,  the  weight  would  be  equally  diminished,  and  would  always \nbe  as  the  product  of  the  body,  by  the  accelerative  gravity. So  in  those  re \ngions,  where  the  accelerative  gravity  is  diminished  into  one  half,  the  weight \nof  a  body  two  or  three  times  less,  will  be  four  or  six  times  less.", "half,  the  weight \nof  a  body  two  or  three  times  less,  will  be  four  or  six  times  less.

SCHOLIUM. Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  the  definitions  of  such  words  as  are  less \nknown,  and  explained  the  sense  in  which  I  would  have  them  to  be  under \nstood  in  the  following  discourse. I  do  not  define  time,  space,  place  and \nmotion,  as  being  well  known  to  all. Only  I  must  observe,  that  the  vulgar \nconceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they \nbear  to  sensible  objects.", "quantities  under  no  other  notions  but  from  the  relation  they \nbear  to  sensible  objects. And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for  the  re \nmoving  of  which,  it  will  be  convenient  to  distinguish  them  into  absolute \nand  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and  common. I. Absolute,  true,  and  mathematical  time,  of  itself,  and  from  its  own  na \nture  flows  equably  without  regard  to  anything  external,  and  by  another \nname  is  called  duration  :  relative,  apparent,  and  common  time,  is  some  sen \nsible  and  external  (whether  accurate  or  unequable)  measure  of  duration  by \nthe  means  of  motion,  which  is  commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ;  such \nas  an  hour,  a  day,  a  month,  a  year. II. Absolute  space,  in  its  own  nature,  without  regard  to  anything  exter \nnal,  remains  always  similar  and  immovable. Relative  space  is  some  mo \nvable  dimension  or  measure  of  the  absolute  spaces ;  which  our  senses  de \ntermine  by  its  position  to  bodies ;  and  which  is  vulgarly  taken  for  immo \nvable  space ;  such  is  the  dimension  of  a  subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or  celestial \nspace,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth.", "us,  an  aereal,  or  celestial \nspace,  determined  by  its  position  in  respect  of  the  earth. Absolute  and \nrelative  space,  are  the  same  in  figure  and  magnitude ;  but  they  do  not  re \nmain  always  numerically  the  same. For  if  the  earth,  for  instance,  moves, \na  space  of  our  air,  which  relatively  and  in  respect  of  the  earth  remains  al \nways  the  same,  will  at  one  time  be  one  part  of  the  absolute  space  into  which", "TS  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \nthe  air  passes  ;  at  another  time  it  will  be  another  part  of  the  same,  and  so. absolutely  understood,  it  will  be  perpetually  mutable. III. Place  is  a  part  of  space  which  a  body  takes  up,  and  is  according  to \nthe  space,  either  absolute  or  relative. I  say,  a  part  of  space ;  not  the  situation, \nnor  the  external  surface  of  the  body. For  the  places  of  equal  solids  are \nalways  equal ;  but  their  superfices,  by  reason  of  their  dissimilar  figures,  are \noften  unequal. Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are  they  so  much \nthe  places  themselves,  as  the  properties  of  places. The  motion  of  the  whole \nis  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  motions  of  the  parts ;  that  is,  the \ntranslation  of  the  whole,  out  of  its  place,  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum \nof  the  translations  of  the  parts  out  of  their  places ;  and  therefore  the  place \nof  the  whole  is  the  same  thing  with  the  sum  of  the  places  of  the  parts,  and \nfor  that  reason,  it  is  internal,  and  in  the  whole  body. IV. Absolute  motion  is  the  translation  of  a  body  from  one  absolute \nplace  into  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative \nplace  into  another.", "nto  another ;  and  relative  motion,  the  translation  from  one  relative \nplace  into  another. Thus  in  a  ship  under  sail,  the  relative  place  of  a  body \nis  that  part  of  the  ship  which  the  body  possesses ;  or  that  part  of  its  cavity \nwhich  the  body  fills,  and  which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship : \nand  relative  rest  is  the  continuance  of  the  body  in  the  same  part  of  the \nship,  or  of  its  cavity. But  real,  absolute  rest,  is  the  continuance  of  the \nbody  in  the  same  part  of  that  immovable  space,  in  which  the  ship  itself, \nits  cavity,  and  all  that  it  contains,  is  moved. Wherefore,  if  the  earth  is \nreally  at  rest,  the  body,  which  relatively  rests  in  the  ship,  will  really  and \nabsolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth.", "ll  really  and \nabsolutely  move  with  the  same  velocity  which  the  ship  has  on  the  earth. But  if  the  earth  also  moves,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  the  body  will \narise,  partly  from  the  true  motion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space ;  partly \nfrom  the  relative  motion  of  the  ship  on  the  earth ;  and  if  the  body  moves \nalso  relatively  in  the  ship ;  its  true  motion  will  arise,  partly  from  the  true \nmotion  of  the  earth,  in  immovable  space,  and  partly  from  the  relative  mo \ntions  as  well  of  the  ship  on  the  earth,  as  of  the  body  in  the  ship  ;  and  from \nthese  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of  the  body  on  the \nearth. As  if  that  part  of  the  earth,  where  the  ship  is,  was  truly  moved \ntoward  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10010  parts;  while  the  ship  itself,  with \na  fresh  gale,  and  full  sails,  is  carried  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  ex \npressed  by  10  of  those  parts  ;  but  a  sailor  walks  in  the  ship  towards  the \neast,  with  1  part  of  the  said  velocity ;  then  the  sailor  will  be  moved  truly \nin  immovable  space  towards  the  east,  with  a  velocity  of  10001  parts,  and \nrelatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts.", ",  and \nrelatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west,  with  a  velocity  of  9  of  those  parts. Absolute  time,  in  astronomy,  is  distinguished  from  relative,  by  the  equa \ntion  or  correction  of  the  vulgar  time. For  the  natural  days  are  tr^y  un \nequal,  though  they  are  commonly  considered  as  equal,  and  used  for  a  meas \nure  of  time ;  astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for  their  more  accurate \ndeducing  of  the  celestial  motions. It  may  be,  that  there  is  no  such  thing \nas  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time  may  H  accurately  measured. All  mo", "OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 79 \ntions  may  be  accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or  equable,  progress  of \nabsolute  time  is  liable  to  no  change. The  duration  or  perseverance  of  the \nexistence  of  things  remains  the  same,  whether  the  motions  are  swift  or  slow, \nor  none  at  all :  and  therefore  it  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  what  are \nonly  sensible  measures  thereof ;  and  out  of  which  we  collect  it,  by  means \nof  the  astronomical  equation. The  necessity  of  which  equation,  for  deter \nmining  the  times  of  a  phamomenon,  is  evinced  as  well  from  the  experiments \nof  the  pendulum  clock,  as  by  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. As  the  order  of  the  parts  of  time  is  immutable,  so  also  is  the  order  of \nthe  parts  of  space. Suppose  those  parts  to  be  moved  out  of  their  places,  and \nthey  will  be  moved  (if  the  expression  may  be  allowed)  out  of  themselves. For  times  and  spaces  are,  as  it  were,  the  places  as  well  of  themselves  as  of \nall  other  things. All  things  are  placed  in  time  as  to  order  of  succession ; \nand  in  space  as  _to  order  of  situation. It  is  from  their  essence  or  nature \nthat  they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be \nmoveable,  is  absurd.", "they  are  places ;  and  that  the  primary  places  of  things  should  be \nmoveable,  is  absurd. These  are  therefore  the  absolute  places ;  and  trans \nlations  out  of  those  places,  are  the  only  absolute  motions. But  because  the  parts  of  space  cannot  be  seen,  or  distinguished  from  one \nanother  by  our  senses,  therefore  in  their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of \nthem. For  from  the  positions  and  distances  of  things  from  any  body  con \nsidered  as  immovable,  we  define  all  places ;  and  then  with  respect  to  such \nplaces,  we  estimate  all  motions,  considering  bodies  as  transferred  from  some \nof  those  places  into  others. And'so,  instead  of  absolute  places  and  motions, \nwe  use  relative  ones;  and  that  without  any  inconvenience  in  common  af \nfairs  ;  but  in  philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our \nsenses,  and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are  only  sensible \nmeasures  of  them. For  it  may  be  that  there  is  no  body  really  at  rest,  to \nwhich  the  places  and  motions  of  others  may  be  referred. But  we  may  distinguish  rest  and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from \nthe  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects.", "ion,  absolute  and  relative,  one  from \nthe  other  by  their  properties,  causes  and  effects. It  is  a  property  of  rest, \nthat  bodies  really  at  rest  do  rest  in  respect  to  one  another. And  therefore \nas  it  is  possible,  that  in  the  remote  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  perhaps \nfar  beyond  them,  there  may  be  some  body  absolutely  at  rest ;  but  impossi \nble  to  know,  from  the  position  of  bodies  to  one  another  in  our  regions \nwhether  any  of  these  do  keep  the  same  position  to  that  remote  body;  it \nfollows  that  absolute  rest  cannot  be  determined  from  the  position  of  bodies \nin  our  regions. It  is  a  property  of  motion,  that  the  parts,  which  retain  given  positions \nto  their  wholes,  do  partake  of  the  motions  of  those  wholes. For  all  the \nparts  of  revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  motion  ; \nand  the  impetus  of  bodies  moving  forward,  arises  from  the  joint  impetus \nof  all  the  parts. Therefore,  if  surrounding  bodies  are  moved,  those  that \nare  relatively  at  rest  within  them,  will  partake  of  their  motion. Upon \nwhich  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a  body  cannot  be  Jeter-", "8C  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \nmined  by  the  translation  of  it  from  those  which  only  seem  to  rest ;  for  the \nexternal  bodies  ought  not  only  to  appear  at  rest,  but  to  be  really  at  rest. For  otherwise,  all  included  bodies,  beside  their  translation  from  near  the \nsurrounding  ones,  partake  likewise  of  their  true  motions ;  and  though  that \ntranslation  were  not  made  they  would  not  be  really  at  rest,  but  only  seem \nto  be  so. For  the  surrounding  bodies  stand  in  the  like  relation  to  the \nsurrounded  as  the  exterior  part  of  a  whole  does  to  the  interior,  or  as  the \nshell  does  to  the  kernel ;  but,  if  the  shell  moves,  the  kernel  will  also \nmove,  as  being  part  of  the  whole,  without  any  removal  from  near  the  shell. A  property,  near  akin  to  the  preceding,  is  this,  that  if  a  place  is  moved, \nwhatever  is  placed  therein  moves  along  with  it ;  and  therefore  a  body, \nwhich  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its \nplace.", "dy, \nwhich  is  moved  from  a  place  in  motion,  partakes  also  of  the  motion  of  its \nplace. Upon  which  account,  all  motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no \nother  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions ;  and  every  entire  motion \nis  composed  of  the  motion  of  the  body  out  of  its  first  place,  and  the \nmotion  of  this  place  out  of  its  place ;  and  so  on,  until  we  come  to  some \nimmovable  place,  as  in  the  before-mentioned  example  of  the  sailor. Where \nfore,  entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be  no  otherwise  determined  than  by \nimmovable  places :  and  for  that  reason  I  did  before  refer  those  absolute \nmotions  to  immovable  places,  but  relative  ones  to  movable  places. Now \nno  other  places  are  immovable  but  those  that,  from  infinity  to  infinity,  do \nall  retain  the  same  given  position  one  to  another ;  and  upon  this  account \nmust  ever  remain  unmoved ;  and  do  thereby  constitute  immovable  space. The  causes  by  which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one \nfrom  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion.", "inguished,  one \nfrom  the  other,  are  the  forces  impressed  upon  bodies  to  generate  motion. True  motion  is  neither  generated  nor  altered,  but  by  some  force  impressed \nupon  the  body  moved :  but  relative  motion  may  be  generated  or  altered \nwithout  any  force  impressed  upon  the  body. For  it  is  sufficient  only  to \nimpress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the  former  is  compared, \nthat  by  their  giving  way,  that  relation  may  be  changed,  in  which  the  re \nlative  rest  or  motion  of  this  other  body  did  consist. Again,  true  motion \nsuffers  always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the  moving \nbody  ;  but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by  such \nforces. For  if  the  same  forces  are  likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies, \nwith  which  the  comparison  is  made,  that  the  relative  position  may  be  pre \nserved,  then  that  condition  will  be  preserved  in  which  the  relative  motion \nconsists. And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be  changed  when  the \ntrue  motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative  may  be  preserved  when  the \ntrue  suffers  some  change.

Yet \nthe  thing  is  not  altogether  desperate :  for  we  have  some  arguments  to \nguide  us,  partly  from  the  apparent  motions,  which  are  the  differences  of \nthe  true  motions ;  partly  from  the  forces,  which  are  the  causes  and  effects \nof  the  true  motions.", "otions ;  partly  from  the  forces,  which  are  the  causes  and  effects \nof  the  true  motions. For  instance,  if  tAvo  globes,  kept  at  a  given  distance \none  from  the  other  by  means  of  a  cord  that  connects  them,  were  revolved \nabout  their  common  centre  of  gravity,  we  might,  from  the  tension  of  the \ncord,  discover  the  endeavour  of  the  globes  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  their \nmotion,  and  from  thence  we  might  compute  the  quantity  of  their  circular \nmotions. And  then  if  any  equal  forces  should  be  impressed  at  once  on  the \nalternate  faces  of  the  globes  to  augment  or  diminish  their  circular  motions, \nfrom  the  increase  or  decr\u00bb  ase  of  the  tensicn  of  1  le  cord,  we  might  infer \nthe  increment  or  decrement  of  their  motions :  and  thence  would  be  found \non  what  faces  those  forces  ought  to  be  impressed,  that  the  motions  of  the \nglobes  might  be  most  augmented  ;  that  is,  we  might  discover  their  hinder- \nmost  faces,  or  those  which,  in  the  circular  motion,  do  follow.

But  now,  if  in  that \nspace  some  remote  bodies  were  placed  that  kept  always  a  given  position \none  to  another,  as  the  fixed  stars  do  in  our  regions,  we  could  not  indeed \ndetermine  from  the  relative  translation  of  the  globes  among  those  bodies, \nwhether  the  motion  did  belong  to  the  globes  or  to  the  bodies. But  if  we \nobserved  the  cord,  and  found  that  its  tension  was  that  very  tension  which \nthe  motions  of  the  globes  required,  we  might  conclude  the  motion  to  be  in \nthe  globes,  and  the  bodies  to  be  at  rest ;  and  then,  lastly,  from  the  trans \nlation  of  the  globes  among  the  bodies,  we  should  find  the  determination  oi \ntheir  motions.", "ion  of  the  globes  among  the  bodies,  we  should  find  the  determination  oi \ntheir  motions.

Through  the \nrentre  O  draw  the  right  line  KOL,  meeting  the  cords  perpendicularly  in \nA  and  L;  and  from  the  centre  O,  with  OL  the  greater  of  the  distances", "OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY.

Now,  it \nbeing  indifferent  whether  the  points  K,  L,  D,  of \nthe  cords  be  lixed  to  the  plane  of  the  wheel  or \nnot,  the  weights  will  have  the  same  effect \nwhether  they  are  suspended  from  the  points  K \nand  L,  or  from  D  and  L. Let  the  whole  force \nof  the  weight  A  be  represented  by  the  line  AD, \nand  let  it  be  resolved  into  the  forces  AC  and \nCD  ;  of  which  the  force  AC,  drawing  the  radius \nOD  directly  from  the  centre,  will  have  no  effect  to  move  the  wheel :  but \nthe  other  force  DC,  drawing  the  radius  DO  perpendicularly,  will  have  the \nsame  effect  as  if  it  drew  perpendicularly  the  radius  OL  equal  to  OD  ;  that \nis,  it  w  ill  have  the  same  effect  as  the  weight  P,  if  that  weight  is  to  the \nweight  A  as  the  force  DC  is  to  the  force  DA  ;  that  is  (because  of  the  sim \nilar  triangles  ADC,  DOK),  as  OK  to  OD  or  OL.", "orce  DA  ;  that  is  (because  of  the  sim \nilar  triangles  ADC,  DOK),  as  OK  to  OD  or  OL. Therefore  the  weights  A \nand  P,  which  are  reciprocally  as  the  radii  OK  and  OL  that  lie  in  the  same \nright  line,  will  be  equipollent,  and  so  remain  in  equilibrio  ;  which  is  the  well \nknown  property  of  the  balance,  the  lever,  and  the  wheel. If  either  weight  is \ngreater  than  in  this  ratio,  its  force  to  move  the  wheel  will  be  so  much  greater. If  the  weight  p,  equal  to  the  weight  P,  is  partly  suspended  by  the \ncord  NJO,  partly  sustained  by  the  oblique  plane  pG ;  draw  p}i,  NH,  the \nformer  perpendicular  to  the  horizon,  the  latter  to  the  plane  pG  ;  and  if \nthe  force  of  the  weight  p  tending  downwards  is  represented  by  the  line \n/?H,  it  may  be  resolved  into  the  forces  joN,  HN.

And  therefore  if  the  plane  pQ  was  taken  away,  so  thnt \nthe  weight  might  stretch  the  cord,  because  the  cord,  now  sustaining  the \nweight,  supplies  the  place  of  the  plane  that  was  removed,  it  will  be  strained \nby  the  same  force  joN  which  pressed  upon  the  plane  before. Therefore, \nthe  tension  of  this  oblique  cord  joN  will  be  to  that  of  the  other  perpendic \nular  cord  PN  as  jt?N  to  joH. And  therefore  if  the  weight  p  is  to  the \nweight  A  in  a  ratio  compounded  of  the  reciprocal  ratio  of  the  least  distances \nof  the  cords  PN,  AM,  from  the  centre  of  the  wheel,  and  of  the  direct  ratio  of \npH  tojoN,  the  weights  will  have  the  same  effect  towards  moving  the  wheel, \nand  will  therefore  sustain  each  other :  as  any  one  may  find  by  experiment. But  the  weight  p  pressing  upon  those  two  oblique  planes,  may  be  con \nsidered  as  a  wedge  between  the  two  internal  surfaces  of  a  body  split  by  it; \nand  hence  tlif  ft  IV.P*  of  th^  v, ^dge  and  the  mallet  may  be  determined;  foi", "8G  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \nbecause  the  force  with  which  the  weight  p  presses  the  plane  pQi  is  to  the \nforce  with  which  the  same,  whether  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  the  blow  of \na  mallet,  is  impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line  joH  towards  both  the \nplanes,  as  joN  to  pH ;  and  to  the  force  with  which  it  presses  the  other \nplane  pG,  as  joN  to  NH. And  thus  the  force  of  the  screw  may  be  deduced \nfrom  a  like  resolution  of  forces ;  it  being  no  other  than  a  wedge  impelled \nwith  the  force  of  a  lever. Therefore  the  use  of  this  Corollary  spreads  far \nand  wide,  and  by  that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is  farther  con \nfirmed. For  on  what  has  been  said  depends  the  whole  doctrine  of  mechan \nics  variously  demonstrated  by  different  authors. For  from  hence  are  easily \ndeduced  the  forces  of  machines,  which  are  compounded  of  wheels,  pullics, \nlevers,  cords,  and  weights,  ascending  directly  or  obliquely,  and  other  mechan \nical  powers ;  as  also  the  force  of  the  tendons  to  move  the  bones  of  animals.

For  action  and  its  opposite  re-action  are  equal,  by  Law  III,  and  there \nfore,  by  Law  II,  they  produce  in  the  motions  equal  changes  towards  oppo \nsite  parts. Therefore  if  the  motions  are  directed  towards  the  same  parts. whatever  is  added  to  the  motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be  subducted \nfrom  the  motion  of  that  which  follows  ;  so  that  the  sum  will  be  the  same \nas  before. If  the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be  an \nequal  deduction  from  the  motions  of  both ;  and  therefore  the  difference  of \nthe  motions  directed  towards  opposite  parts  will  remain  the  same. Thus  if  a  spherical  body  A  with  two  parts  of  velocity  is  triple  of  a \nspherical  body  B  which  follows  in  the  same  right  line  with  ten  parts  of \nvelocity,  the  motion  of  A  will  be  to  that  of  B  as  6  to  10.", "line  with  ten  parts  of \nvelocity,  the  motion  of  A  will  be  to  that  of  B  as  6  to  10. Suppose, \nthen,  their  motions  to  be  of  6  parts  and  of  10  parts,  and  the  sum  will  be \n16  parts. Therefore,  upon  the  meeting  of  the  bodies,  if  A  acquire  3,  4, \nor  5  parts  of  motion,  B  will  lose  as  many ;  and  therefore  after  reflexion \nA  will  proceed  With  9,  10,  or  11  parts,  and  B  with  7,  6,  or  5  parts;  the \nsum  remaining  always  of  16  parts  as  before. If  the  body  A  acquire  9, \n10,  11,  or  12  parts  of  motion,  and  therefore  after  meeting  proceed  with \n15,  16,  17,  or  18  parts,  the  body  B,  losing  so  many  parts  as  A  has  got, \nwill  either  proceed  with  1  part,  having  lost  9,  or  stop  and  remain  at  rest, \nas  having  lost  its  whole  progressive  motion  of  10  parts ;  or  it  will  go  back \nwith  1  part,  having  not  only  lost  its  whole  motion,  but  (if  1  may  so  say) \none  part  more;  or  it  will  go  back  with  2  parts,  because  a  progressive  mo \ntion  of  12  parts  is  taken  off. And  so  the  sums  of  the  Conspiring  motions \n15  ,1,  or  16-1-0,  and  the  differences  of  the  contrary  i  otions  17 \u2014 1  and", "OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. [S \u2014 2,  will  always  be  equal  to  16  parts,  as  they  were  before  tie  meeting \nand  reflexion  of  the  bodies. But,  the  motions  being  known  with  whicli \nthe  bodies  proceed  after  reflexion,  the  velocity  of  either  will  be  also  known, \nby  taking  the  velocity  after  to  the  velocity  before  reflexion,  as  the  motion \nafter  is  to  the  motion  before. As  in  the  last  case,  where  the  motion  of  tho \nbody  A  was  of  0  parts  before  reflexion  and  of  IS  parts  after,  and  the \nvelocity  was  of  2  parts  before  reflexion,  the  velocity  thereof  after  reflexion \nwill  be  found  to  be  of  6  parts ;  by  saying,  as  the  0  parts  of  motion  before \nto  18  parts  after,  so  are  2  parts  of  velocity  before  reflexion  to  (5  parts  after. But  if  the  bodies  are  cither  not  spherical,  or,  moving  in  different  right \nlines,  impinge  obliquely  one  upon  the  other,  and  their  mot'ons  after  re \nflexion  are  required,  in  those  cases  we  are  first  to  determine  the  position \nof  the  plane  that  touches  the  concurring  bodies  in  the  point  of  concourse  , \nthen  the  motion  of  each  body  (by  Corol.

This  done,  be \ncause  the  bodies  act  upon  each  other  in  the  direction  of  a  line  perpendicu \nlar  to  this  plane,  the  parallel  motions  are  to  be  retained  the  same  after \nreflexion  as  before ;  and  to  the  perpendicular  motions  we  are  to  assign \nequal  changes  towards  the  contrary  parts ;  in  such  manner  that  the  sum \nof  the  conspiring  and  the  difference  of  the  contrary  motions  may  remain \nthe  same  as  before. From  such  kind  of  reflexions  also  sometimes  arise \nthe  circular  motions  of  bodies  about  their  own  centres.

The  common  centre  of  gravity  of  two  or  more  bodies  does  not  alter  its \nstate  of  'motion  or  rest  by  the  actions  of  the  bodies  among  themselves ; \nand  therefore  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  all  bodies  acting  upon \neach  other  (excluding  outward  actions  and  impediments)  is  either  at \nrest,  or  moves  uniformly  in  a  right  line.", "utward  actions  and  impediments)  is  either  at \nrest,  or  moves  uniformly  in  a  right  line.

Therefore  if  any  number  of \nKdies  move  uniformly  in  right  lines,  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  any \ntwo  of  them  is  either  at  rest,  or  proceeds  uniformly  in  a  right  line ;  because \nthe  line  which  connects  the  centres  of  those  two  bodies  so  moving  is  divided  at \nthat  common  centre  in  a  given  ratio. In  like  manner  the  common  centre \nof  those  two  and  that  of  a  third  body  will  be  either  at  rest  or  moving  uni \nformly  in  aright  line  because  at  that  centre  the  distance  1  etween  th\u00ab?", "88  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \ncommon  centre  of  the  two  bodies,  and  the  centre  of  this  last,  is  divided  in \na  given  ratio. In  like  manner  the  common  centre  of  these  three,  and  of  a \nfourth  body,  is  either  at  rest,  or  moves  uniformly  in  a  right  line ;  because \nthe  distance  between  the  common  centre  of  the  three  bodies,  and  the  centre \nof  the  fourth  is  there  also  divided  in  a  given  ratio,  and  so  on  m  itifinitum. Therefore,  in  a  system  of  bodies  where  there  is  neither  any  mutual  action \namong  themselves,  nor  any  foreign  force  impressed  upon  them  from  without, \nand  which  consequently  move  uniformly  in  right  lines,  the  common  centre  of \ngravity  of  them  all  is  either  at  rest  or  moves  uniformly  forward  in  a  right  line. Moreover,  in  a  system  of  two  bodies  mutually  acting  upon  each  other, \nsince  the  distances  between  their  centres  and  the  common  centre  of  gravity \nof  both  are  reciprocally  as  the  bodies,  the  relative  motions  of  those  bodies, \nwhether  of  approaching  to  or  of  receding  from  that  centre,  will  be  equal \namong  themselves.", "her  of  approaching  to  or  of  receding  from  that  centre,  will  be  equal \namong  themselves. Therefore  since  the  changes  which  happen  to  motions \nare  equal  and  directed  to  contrary  parts,  the  common  centre  of  those  bodies, \nby  their  mutual  action  between  themselves,  is  neither  promoted  nor  re \ntarded,  nor  suffers  any  change  as  to  its  state  of  motion  or  rest. But  in  a \nsystem  of  several  bodies,  because  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  any  two \nacting  mutually  upon  each  other  suffers  no  change  in  its  state  by  that  ac \ntion  :  and  much  less  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  others  with  which \nthat  action  does  not  intervene ;  but  the  distance  between  those  two  centres \nis  divided  by  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  all  the  bodies  into  parts  re \nciprocally  proportional  to  the  total  sums  of  those  bodies  whose  centres  they \nare :  and  therefore  while  those  two  centres  retain  their  state  of  motion  or \nrest,  xhe  common  centre  of  all  does  also  retain  its  state :  it  is  manifest  that \nthe  common  centre  of  all  never  suffers  any  change  in  the  state  of  its  mo \ntion  or  rest  from  the  actions  of  any  two  bodies  between  themselves.", "state  of  its  mo \ntion  or  rest  from  the  actions  of  any  two  bodies  between  themselves.

SCHOLIUM. Hitherto  I  have  laid  down  such  principles  as  have  been  received  by  math \nematicians,  and  are  confirmed  by  abundance  of  experiments. By  the  first \ntwo  Laws  and  the  first  two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de \nscent  of  bodies  observed  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time,  and  that  the  mo \ntion  of  projectiles  was  in  the  curve  of  a  parabola;  experience  agreeing \nwith  both,  unless  so  far  as  these  motions  are  a  little  retarded  by  the  re \nsistance  of  the  air. When  a  body  is  falling,  the  uniform  force  of  its \ngravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in  equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces \nupon  that  body,  and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in  the  whole \ntime  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional \nto  the  time.", "time  impresses  a  whole  force,  and  generates  a  whole  velocity  proportional \nto  the  time. And  the  spaces  described  in  proportional  times  are  as  the \nvelocities  and  the  times  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the \ntimes. And  when  a  body  is  thrown  upwards,  its  uniform  gravity  im \npresses  forces  and  takes  off  velocities  proportional  to  the  times ;  and  the \ntimes  of  ascending  to  the  greatest  heights  are  as  the  velocities  to  be  taken \noff,  and  those  heights  are  as  the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir, \nthe  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocities. And  if  a  body  be  projected  in  any \ndirection,  the  motion  arising  from  its  projection  jS  compounded  with  the", "90 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \nmotion  arising  from  its  gravity. As  if  the  body  A  by  its  motion  of  pio- \njection  alone  could  describe  in  a  given  time  the  right  line \nAB,  and  with  its  motion  of  falling  alone  could  describe  in \nthe  same  time  the  altitude  AC  ;  complete  the  paralello- \ngram  ABDC,  and  the  body  by  that  compounded  motion \nwill  at  the  end  of  the  time  be  found  in  the  place  D  ;  and \nthe  curve  line  AED,  which  that  body  describes,  will  be  a \nparabola,  to  which  the  right  line  AB  will  be  a  tangent  in \nA  ;  and  whose  ordinate  BD  will  be  as  the  square  of  the  line  AB. On  the \nsame  Laws  and  Corollaries  depend  those  things  which  have  been  demon \nstrated  concerning  the  times  of  the  vibration  of  pendulums,  and  are  con \nfirmed  by  the  daily  experiments  of  pendulum  clocks. By  the  same,  to \ngether  with  the  third  Law,  Sir  Christ.

Dr. Wallis,  indeed,  was  something \nmore  early  in  the  publication  ;  then  followed  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  and, \nlastly,  Mr. Huygens. But  Sir  Christopher  Wren  confirmed  the  truth  of \nthe  thing  before  the  Royal  Society  by  the  experiment  of  pendulums,  which \nMr. Mariottc  soon  after  thought  fit  to  explain  in  a  treatise  entirely  upon \nthat  subject. But  to  bring  this  experiment  to  an  accurate  agreement  with \nthe  theory,  we  are  to  have  a  due  regard  as  well  to  the  resistance  of  the  air \nbodies.

About  these  centres,  with  those \nintervals,  describe  the  semicircles  EAF, \nGBH,  bisected  by  the  radii  CA,  DB. Bring  the  body  A  to  any  point  R  of  the \narc  EAF,  and  (withdrawing  the  body \nB)  let  it  go  from  thence,  and  after  one  oscillation  suppose  it  to  return  to \nthe  point  V  :  then  RV  will  be  the  retardation  arising  from  the  resistance \nof  the  air. Of  this  RV  let  ST  be  a  fourth  part,  situated  in  the  middle.", "e  resistance \nof  the  air. Of  this  RV  let  ST  be  a  fourth  part,  situated  in  the  middle. to  wit,  so  as  RS  and  TV  may  be  equal,  and  RS  may  be  to  ST  as  3  to  2 \nthen  will  ST  represent  very  nearly  the  retardation  during  the  descent \nfrom  S  to  A. Restore  the  body  B  to  its  place:  and,  supjx  sing  the  body \nA  to  be  let  fall  from  the  point  S,  the  velocity  thereof  in  the  place  of  re \nflexion  A,  without  sensible  error,  will  be  the  same  as  if  it  had  descended \nm  vacit.o  from  the  point  T. Upon  which  account  this  velocity  may  be \nrepresented  by  the  chord  of  the  arc  TA. For  it  is  a  proposition  well \nknown  to  geometers,  that  the  velocity  of  a  pendulous  body  in  the  loAvest \npoint  is  as  the  chord  of  the  arc  which  it  has  described  in  its  descent.

In  the  s.ime  way  we  are  to \ncorrect  the  place  k  to  which  the  body  B  ascends,  by  finding  the  place  I  to \nwhich  it  should  have  ascended  in  vacuo.

And  in  like  manner, \nwhen  two  bodies  are  let  go  together  from  different  places,  we  are  to  find \nthe  motion  of  each,  as  well  before  as  after  reflexion;  and  then  we  may \ncompare  the  motions  between  themselves,  and  collect  the  effects  of  the  re \nflexion.", "may \ncompare  the  motions  between  themselves,  and  collect  the  effects  of  the  re \nflexion. Thus  trying  the  thing  with  pendulums  of  ten  feet,  in  unequal \nas  well  as  equal  bodies,  and  making  the  bodies  to  concur  after  a  descent \nthrough  large  spaces,  as  of  8,  12,  or  16  feet,  I  found  always,  without  an \nerror  of  3  inches,  that  when  the  bodies  concurred  together  directly,  equal \nchanges  towards  the  contrary  parts  were  produced  in  their  motions,  and, \nof  consequence,  that  the  action  and  reaction  were  always  equal. As  if  the \nbody  A  impinged  upon  the  body  B  at  rest  with  9  parts  of  motion,  and \nlosing  7,  proceeded  after  reflexion  with  2,  the  body  B  was  carried  back \nwards  with  those  7  parts. If  the  bodies  concurred  with  contrary  motions, \nA  with  twelve  parts  of  motion,  and  B  with  six,  then  if  A  receded  with  J4, \nB  receded  with  8 ;  to  wit,  with  a  deduction  of  14  parts  of  motion  on \neach  side. For  from  the  motion  of  A  subducting  twelve  parts,  nothing \nwill  remain ;  but  subducting  2  parts  more,  a  motion  will  be  generated  of \n2  parts  towards  the  contrary  way ;  and  so,  from  the  motion  of  the  body \nB  of  6  parts,  subducting  14  parts,  a  motion  is  generated  of  8  parts  towards \nthe  contrary  way.", "parts,  subducting  14  parts,  a  motion  is  generated  of  8  parts  towards \nthe  contrary  way.

For  the  error  of  an  inch  or  two  in  measures  may  be  easily  ascribed  to  tht", "92  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \ndifficulty  of  executing  everything  with  accuracy. It  was  not  easy  to  let \ngo  the  two  pendulums  so  exactly  together  that  the  bodies  should  impinge \none  upon  the  other  in  the  lowermost  place  AB ;  nor  to  mark  the  places  s, \nand  ky  to  which  the  bodies  ascended  after  congress. Nay,  and  some  errors, \ntoo,  might  have  happened  from  the  unequal  density  of  the  parts  of  the  pen \ndulous  bodies  themselves,  and  from  the  irregularity  of  the  texture  pro \nceeding  from  other  causes. But  to  prevent  an  objection  that  may  perhaps  be  alledged  against  the \nrule,  for  the  proof  of  which  this  experiment  was  made,  as  if  this  rule  did \nsuppose  that  the  bodies  were  either  absolutely  hard,  or  at  least  perfectly \nelastic  (whereas  no  such  bodies  are  to  be  found  in  nature),  1  must  add. that \nthe  experiments  we  have  been  describing,  by  no  means  depending  upon \nthat  quality  of  hardness,  do  succeed  as  well  in  soft  as  in  hard  bodies. For \nif  the  rule  is  to  be  tried  in  bodies  not  perfectly  hard,  we  are  only  to  di \nminish  the  reflexion  in  such  a  certain  proportion  as  the  quantity  of  the \nelastic  force  requires.", "reflexion  in  such  a  certain  proportion  as  the  quantity  of  the \nelastic  force  requires. By  the  theory  of  Wren  and  Huygens,  bodies  abso \nlutely  hard  return  one  from  another  with  the  same  velocity  with  which \nthey  meet. But  this  may  be  affirmed  with  more  certainty  of  bodies  per \nfectly  elastic. In  bodies  imperfectly  elastic  the  velocity  of  the  return  is  to \nbe  diminished  together  with  the  elastic  force ;  because  that  force  (except \nwhen  the  parts  of  bodies  are  bruised  by  their  congress,  or  suffer  some  such \nextension  as  happens  under  the  strokes  of  a  hammer)  is  (as  far  as  I  can  per \nceive)  certain  and  determined,  and  makes  the  bodies  to  return  one  from \nthe  other  with  a  relative  velocity,  which  is  in  a  given  ratio  to  that  relative \nvelocity  with  which  they  met. This  I  tried  in  balls  of  wool,  made  up \ntightly,  and  strongly  compressed. For,  first,  by  letting  go  the  pendulous \nbodies,  and  measuring  their  reflexion,  I  determined  the  quantity  of  their \nelastic  force ;  and  then,  according  to  this  force,  estimated  the  reflexions \nthat  ought  to  happen  in  other  cases  of  congress.", "this  force,  estimated  the  reflexions \nthat  ought  to  happen  in  other  cases  of  congress. And  with  this  computa \ntion  other  experiments  made  afterwards  did  accordingly  agree ;  the  balls \nalways  receding  one  from  the  other  with  a  relative  velocity,  which  was  to \nthe  relative  velocity  with  which  they  met  as  about  5  to  9.

And  thus  the  third  Law,  so  far  as  it  regards  percussions  and  reflexions,  is \nproved  by  a  theory  exactly  agreeing  with  experience. In  attractions,  I  briefly  demonstrate  the  thing  after  this  manner. Sup \npose  an  obstacle  is  interposed  to  hinder  the  congress  of  any  two  bodies  A.", "manner.

For,  by  the  first  Law,  the  system  ought  to  per \nsevere  in  its  state  of  rest,  or  of  moving  uniformly  forward  in  a  right  line : \nand  therefore  the  bodies  must  equally  press  the  obstacle,  and  be  equally \nattracted  one  by  the  other. I  made  the  experiment  on  the  loadstone  and \niron. If  these,  placed  apart  in  proper  vessels,  are  made  to  float  by  one \nanother  in  standing  water,  neither  of  them  will  propel  the  other ;  but, \nby  being  equally  attracted,  they  will  sustain  each  other's  pressure,  and  rest \nat  last  in  an  equilibrium. So  the  gravitation  betwixt  the  earth  and  its  parts  is  mutual. Let  the \nearth  FI  be  cut  by  any  plane  EG  into  two  parts  EGF \nand  EGI,  and  their  weights  one  towards  the  other \nwill  be  mutually  equal.

But  the  one  extreme \npart  HKI  will  with  its  whole  weight  bear  upon  and  press  the  middle  part \ntowards  the  other  extreme  part  EGF :  and  therefore  the  force  with  which \nEGI,  the  sum  of  the  parts  HKI  and  EGKH,  tends  towards  the  third  part \nEGF,  is  equal  to  the  weight  of  the  part  HKI,  that  is,  to  the  weight  of \nthe  third  part  EGF. And  therefore  the  weights  of  the  two  parts  EGI \nand  EGF,  one  towards  the  other,  are  equal,  as  I  was  to  prove. And  in \ndeed  if  those  weights  were  not  equal,  the  whole  earth  floating  in  the  non- \nresisting  aether  would  give  way  to  the  greater  weight,  and,  retiring  from \nit,  would  be  carried  off  in  infinitum.", "way  to  the  greater  weight,  and,  retiring  from \nit,  would  be  carried  off  in  infinitum.

PROPOSITION  IV. THEOREM  IV. The  centripetal  forces  of  bodies,  which  by  equable  'motions  describe  differ \nent  circles,  tend  to  the  centres  of  the  same  circles  ;  and  are  one  to  tJie \nother  as  the  squares  of  t/ie  arcs  described  in  equal  times  applied  to  the \nradii  of  the  circles. These  forces  tend  to  the  centres  of  the  circles  (by  Prop. II.,  and  Cor. 2, \nProp. L),  and  are  one  to  another  as  the  versed  sines  of  the  least  arcs  de \nscribed  in  equal  times  (by  Cor. 4,  Prop. I.) ;  that  is,  as  the  squares  of  the \nsame  arcs  applied  to  the  diameters  of  the  circles  (by  Lem.", "is,  as  the  squares  of  the \nsame  arcs  applied  to  the  diameters  of  the  circles  (by  Lem. VII.) ;  and  there \nfore  since  those  arcs  are  as  arcs  described  in  any  equal  times,  and  the  dia- \nme  ers  ace  as  the  radii,  the  forces  will  be  as  the  squares  of  any  arcs  de- \nscr  bed  in  the  same  time  applied  to  the  radii  of  the  circles. Q.E.D. ^OR. 1. Therefore,  since  those  arcs  are  as  the  velocities  of  the  bodies.", "I  OS  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    . the  centripetal  forces  are  in  a  ratio  compounded  of  the  duplicate  ra'jio  of \nthe  velocities  directly,  and  of  the  simple  ratio  of  the  radii  inversely. COR. 2. And  since  the  periodic  times  are  in  a  ratio  compounded  of  the \nratio  of  the  radii  directly,  and  the  ratio  of  the  velocities  inversely,  the  cen \ntripetal  forces,  are  in  a  ratio  compounded  of  the  ratio  of  the  radii  directly, \nand  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  periodic  times  inversely.

COR. 5. If  the  periodic  times  are  as  the  radii,  and  therefore  the  veloci \nties  equal,  the  centripetal  forces  will  be  reciprocally  as  the  radii ;  and  the \ncontrary.

And  the \napplication  is  easy,  by  only  substituting  the  equable  description  of  areas  in \nthe  place  of  equable  motion,  and  using  the  distances  of  the  bodies  from  the \ncentres  instead  of  the  radii.

From  the  same  demonstration  it  likewise  follows,  that  the  arc \nwhich  a  body,  uniformly  revolving  in  a  circle  by  means  of  a  given  centri \npetal  force,  describes  in  any  time,  is  a  mean  proportional  between  the \ndiameter  of  the  circle,  and  the  space  which  the  same  body  falling  by  the \nsame  given  force  would  descend  through  in  the  same  given  time. SCHOLIUM. The  case  of  the  6th  Corollary  obtains  in  the  celestial  bodies  (as  Sir \nChristopher  Wren,  Dr. Hooke,  and  Dr. Halley  have  severally  observed)  ; \nand  therefore  in  what  follows,  I  intend  to  treat  more  at  large  of  those \nthings  which  relate  to  centripetal  force  decreasing  in  a  duplicate  ratio \nof  the  distances  from  the  centres. Moreover,  by  means  of  the  preceding  Proposition  and  its  Corollaries,  we", "SEC. II.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 109 \nmay  discover  the  proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known \nforce,  such  as  that  of  gravity. For  if  a  body  by  means  of  its  gravity  re \nvolves  in  a  circle  concentric  to  the  earth,  this  gravity  is  the  centripetal \nforce  of  that  body. But  from  the  descent  of  heavy  bodies,  the  time  of  one \nentire  revolution,  as  well  as  the  arc  described  in  any  given  time,  is  given \n(by  Cor. 9  of  this  Prop.). And  by  such  propositions,  Mr. Huygens,  in  his \nexcellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has  compared  the  force  of \ngravity  with  the  centrifugal  forces  of  revolving  bodies. The  preceding  Proposition  may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this \nmanner. In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number \nof  sides.", "this \nmanner. In  any  circle  suppose  a  polygon  to  be  inscribed  of  any  number \nof  sides. And  if  a  body,  moved  with  a  given  velocity  along  the  sides  of  the \npolygon,  is  reflected  from  the  circle  at  the  several  angular  points,  the  force, \nwith  which  at  every  reflection  it  strikes  the  circle,  will  be  as  its  velocity  : \nand  therefore  the  sum  of  the  forces,  in  a  given  time,  will  be  as  that  ve \nlocity  and  the  number  of  reflections  conjunctly ;  that  is  (if  the  species  of \nthe  polygon  be  given),  as  the  length  described  in  that  given  time,  and  in \ncreased  or  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  same  length  to  the  radius  of  the \ncircle ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  that  length  applied  to  the  radius ;  and \ntherefore  the  polygon,  by  having  its  sides  diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin \ncides  with  the  circle,  as  the  square  of  the  arc  described  in  a  given  time  ap \nplied  to  the  radius.

But  the  constructions \nbeing  demonstrated  where  that  right  line  does  cut  the  trajectory,  the  con \nstructions  where  it  does  not  are  also  known ;  and  therefore,  for  brevity's \nsake,  I  omit  any  farther  demonstration  of  them.

Suppose  that  any  figure  HGI  is  to  be \ntransformed. Draw,  at  pleasure,  two  par \nallel  lines  AO,  BL,  cutting  any  third  line \nAB,  given  by  position,  in  A  and  B,  and  from \nany  point  G  of  the  figure,  draw  out  any \nright  line  GD,  parallel  to  OA,  till  it  meet \nthe  right  line  AB. Then  from  any  given \npoint  0  in  the  line  OA,  draw  to  the  point \nD  the  right  line  OD,  meeting  BL  in  d  ;  and \nfrom  the  point  of  concourse  raise  the  right \nline  dg  containing  any  given  angle  with  the  right  line  BL,  and  having \nsuch  ratio  to  Qd  as  DG  has  to  OD ;  and  g  will  be  the  point  in  the  new \nfigure  hgi,  corresponding  to  the  point  G. And  in  like  manner  the  several \npoints  of  the  first  figure  will  give  as  many  correspondent  points  of  the  new \nfigure. If  we  therefore  conceive  the  point  G  to  be  carried  along  by  a  con \ntinual  motion  through  all  the  points  of  the  first  figure,  the  point  g  will \nbe  likewise  carried  along  by  a  continual  motion  through  all  the  points  of \nthe  new  figure,  and  describe  the  same.", "y  a  continual  motion  through  all  the  points  of \nthe  new  figure,  and  describe  the  same. For  distinction's  sake,  let  us  call \nDG  the  first  ordinate,  dg  the  new  ordinate,  AD  the  first  abscissa,  ad  the \nnew  abscissa ;  O  the  pole. OD  the  abscinding  radius,  OA  the  first  ordinate \nradius,  and  Oa  (by  which  the  parallelogram  OABa  is  completed)  the  new \nordinate  radius. I  say,  then,  that  if  the  point  G  is  placed  in  a  right  line  given  by  posi \ntion,  the  point  g  will  be  also  placed  in  a  right  line  given  by  position. If \nthe  point  G  is  placed  in  a  conic  section,  the  point  g  will  be  likewise  placed", "J42  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    1. in  a  conic  section. And  here  I  understand  the  circle  as  one  of  the  conic \nsections. But  farther,  if  the  point  G  is  placed  in  a  line  of  the  third  ana \nlytical  order,  the  point  g  will  also  be  placed  in  a  line  of  the  third  order, \nand  so  on  in  curve  lines  of  higher  orders. The  two  lines  in  which  the \npoints  G,  g,  are  placed,  will  be  always  of  the  same  analytical  order. For \nas  ad  is  to  OA,  so  are  Od  to  OD,  dg  to  DG,  and  AB  to  AD ;  and  there- \nOA  X  AB  OA  X  dg \nfore  AD  is  equal  to   ,   ,  and  DG  equal  to   7\u2014 \u2014 . Now  if  the \nad  ad \npoint  G  is  placed  in  a  right  line,  and  therefore,  in  any  equation  by  which \nthe  relation  between  the  abscissa  AD  and  the  ordinate  GD  is  expressed, \nthose  indetermined  lines  AD  and  DG  rise  no  higher  than  to  one  dimen- \nv         v       xu-  ,.

But  if  AD  and  DG  (or  either  of \nthem)  had  risen  to  two  dimensions  in  the  first  equation,  ad  and  dg  would \nlikewise  have  risen  to  tAvo  dimensions  in  the  second  equation. And  so  on \nin  three  or  more  dimensions. The  indetermined  lines,  ad}  dg  in  the \nsecond  equation,  and  AD,  DG,  in  the  first,  will  always  rise  to  the  same \nnumber  of  dimensions ;  and  therefore  the  lines  in  which  the  points  G,  g, \nare  placed  are  of  the  same  analytical  order. I  say  farther,  that  if  any  right  line  touches  the  curve  line  in  the  first \nfigure,  the  same  right  line  transferred  the  same  way  with  the  curve  into \nthe  new  figure  will  touch  that  curve  line  in  the  new  figure,  and  vice  versa. For  if  any  two  points  of  the  curve  in  the  first  figure  are  supposed  to  ap \nproach  one  the  other  till  they  come  to  coincide,  the  same  points  transferred \nwill  approach  one  the  other  till  they  come  to  coincide  in  the  new  figure ; \nand  therefore  the  right  lines  with  which  those  points  are  joined  will  be \ncome  together  tangents  of  the  curves  in  both  figures.", "those  points  are  joined  will  be \ncome  together  tangents  of  the  curves  in  both  figures. I  might  have  given \ndemonstrations  of  these  assertions  in  a  more  geometrical  form ;  but  I  study \nto  be  brief. Wherefore  if  one  rectilinear  figure  is  to  be  transformed  into  another,  we \nneed  only  transfer  the  intersections  of  the  right  lines  of  which  the  first \nfigure  consists,  and  through  the  transferred  intersections  to  draw  right  lines \nin  the  new  figure. But  if  a  curvilinear  figure  is  to  be  transformed,  we \nmust  transfer  the  points,  the  tangents,  and  other  right  lines,  by  means  of \nwhich  the  curve  line  is  denned. This  Lemma  is  of  use  in  the  solution  of \nthe  more  difficult  Problems ;  for  thereby  we  maj'  transform  the  proposed \nfigures,  if  they  are  intricate,  into  others  that  are  more  simple. Thus  any \nright  lines  converging  to  a  point  are  transformed  into  parallels,  by  taking \nfor  the  first  ordinate  radius  any  right  line  that  passes  through  the  point \nof  concourse  of  the  converging  lines,  and  that  because  their  point  of  con-", "SEC.

And  after  the  problem  is \nsolved  in  the  new  figure,  if  by  the  inverse  operations  we  transform  the \nnew  into  the  first  figure,  we  shall  have  the  solution  required. This  Lemma  is  also  of  use  in  the  solution  of  solid  problems. For  as \noften  as  two  conic  sections  occur,  by  the  intersection  of  which  a  problem \nmay  be  solved,  any  one  of  them  may  be  transformed,  if  it  is  an  hyperbola \nor  a  parabola,  into  an  ellipsis,  and  then  this  ellipsis  may  be  easily  changed \ninto  a  circle. So  also  a  right  line  and  a  conic  section,  in  the  construc \ntion  of  plane  problems,  may  be  transformed  into  a  right  line  and  a  circle \nPROPOSITION  XXV. PROBLEM   XVII.

There  is  no  oval  figure  whose  area,  cut  off  by  right  lines  at  pleasure,  can, \nbe  universally  found  by  means  of  equations  of  any  number  of  finite \nterms  and  dimensions. Suppose  that  within  the  oval  any  point  is  given,  about  which  as  a  pole \na  right  line  is  perpetually  revolving  with  an  uniform  motion,  while  in \nthat  right  line  a  mov cable  point  going  out  from  the  pole  moves  always \nforward  with  a  velocity  proportional  to  the  square  of  that  right  line  with \nin  the  oval. By  this  motion  that  point  will  describe  a  spiral  with  infinite \ncircumgyrations. Now  if  a  portion  of  the  area  of  the  oval  cut  off  by  that \nright  line  could  be  found  by  a  finite  equation,  the  distance  of  the  point \nfrom  the  pole,  which  is  proportional  to  this  area,  might  be  found  by  the \nsame  equation,  and  therefore  all  the  points  of  the  spiral  might  be  found \nby  a  finite  equation  also ;  and  therefore  the  intersection  of  a  right  line \ngiven  in  position  with  the  spiral  might  also  be  found  by  a  finite  equation.", "ight  line \ngiven  in  position  with  the  spiral  might  also  be  found  by  a  finite  equation. But  every  right  line  infinitely  produced  cuts  a  spiral  in  an  infinite  num \nber  of  points  ;  and  the  equation  by  which  any  one  intersection  of  two  lines \nis  found  at  the  same  time  exhibits  all  their  intersections  by  as  many  roots, \nand  therefore  rises  to  as  many  dimensions  as  there  are  intersections.

Because  there  may  b(- \nfour  intersections  of  two  conic  sections,  any  one  of  them  is  not  to  be  found \nuniversally,  but  by  an  equation  of  four  dimensions,  by  which  they  may  bi> \nall  found  together. For  if  those  intersections  are  severally  sought,  be \ncause  the  law  and  condition  of  all  is  the  same,  the  calculus  will  be  the \nsame  in  every  case,  and  therefore  the  conclusion  always  the  same,  which \nmust  therefore  comprehend  all  those  intersections  at  once  within  itself,  and \nexhibit  them  all  indifferently. Hence  it  is  that  the  intersections  of  the \nconic  se\"f  ions  with  the  curves  of  the  third  order,  because  they  may  amount \nto  six,  (\\,me  out  together  by  equations  of  six  dimensions ;  and  the  inter \nsections  of  two  curves  of  the  third  order,  because  they  may  amount  to  nine, \ncome  out  together  by  equations  of  nine  dimensions. If  this  did  not  ne \ncessarily  happen,  we  might  reduce  all  solid  to  plane  Problems,  and  those \nhigher  than  solid  to  solid  Problems. But  here  i  speak  of  curves  irreduci \nble  in  power.", "higher  than  solid  to  solid  Problems. But  here  i  speak  of  curves  irreduci \nble  in  power. For  if  the  equation  by  which  the  curve  is  defined  may  bo \nreduced  to  a  lower  power,  the  curve  will  not  be  one  single  curve,  but  com \nposed  of  two,  or  more,  whose  intersections  may  be  severally  found  by  different \ncalculusses. After  the  same  manner  the  two  intersections  of  right  lines \nwith  the  conic  sections  come  out  always  by  equations  of  two  dimensions ;  the \nthree  intersections  of  right  lines  with  the  irreducible  curves  of  the  third \nurder  by  equations  of  three  dimensions ;  the  four  intersections  of  right \nlines  with  the  irreducible  curves  of  the  fourth  order,  by  equations  of  four \ndimensions  ;  and  so  on  in  iitfinitum. Wherefore  the  innumerable  inter \nsections  of  a  right  line  with  a  spiral,  since  this  is  but  one  simple  curve \nand  not  reducible  to  more  curves,  require  equations  infinite  in  r-  .imber  of \ndimensions  and  roots,  by  which  they  may  be  all  exhibited  together.

For  if  a  perpendicular  is  let  fall \nfrom  the  pole  upon  that  intersecting  right  line,  and  that  perpendicular \ntogether  with  the  intersecting  line  revolves  about  the  pole,  the  intersec \ntions  of  the  spiral  will  mutually  pass  the  one  into  the  other ;  and  that \nwhich  was  first  or  nearest,  after  one  revolution,  will  be  the  second ;  after \ntwo,  the  third ;  and  so  on :  nor  will  the  equation  in  the  mean  time  be \nchanged  but  as  the  magnitudes  of  those  quantities  are  changed,  by  which \nthe  position  of  the  intersecting  line  is  determined. Wherefore  since  those \nquantities  after  every  revolution  return  to  their  first  magnitudes,  the  equa \ntion  will  return  to  its  first  form ;  and  consequently  one  and  the  same \nequation  will  exhibit  all  the  intersections,  and  will  therefore  have  an  infi \nnite  number  of  roots,  by  which  they  may  be  all  exhibited. And  therefore \nthe  intersection  of  a  right  line  with  a  spiral  cannot  be  universally  found  by \nany  finite  equation ;  and  of  consequence  there  is  no  oval  figure  whose  area, \ncut  off  by  right  lines  at  pleasure,  can  be  universally  exhibited  by  an^ \nsuch  equation.", "1 56 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BOOK   1 \nBy  the  same  argument,  if  the  interval  of  the  pole  and  point  by  which \nthe  spiral  is  described  is  taken  proportional  to  that  part  of  the  perimeter \nof  the  oval  which  is  cut  off,  it  may  be  proved  that  the  length  of  the  peri \nmeter  cannot  be  universally  exhibited  by  any  finite  equation.

By  any  construction  (or  even \nby  conjecture),  suppose  we  know  P  the  place  of  the  body  near  its  true \nplace  jo. Then  letting  fall  on  the  axis  of  the  ellipsis  the  ordinate  PR \nfrom  the  proportion  of  the  diameters  of  the  ellipsis,  the  ordinate  RQ  of \nthe  circumscribed  circle  AQB  will  be  given  ;  which  ordinate  is  the  sine  of \nthe  angle  AOQ,  supposing  AO  to  be  the  radius,  and  also  cuts  the  ellipsis \nin  P. It  will  .be  sufficient  if  that  angle  is  found  by  a  rude  calculus  in \nnumbers  near  the  truth. Suppose  we  also  know  the  angle  proportional  to \nthe  time,  that  is,  which  is  to  four  right  a  iules  as  the  time  in  which  tlie \nbody  described  the  arc  A/?,  to  the  time  of  one  revolution  in  the  ellipsis. Let  this  angle  be  N. Then  take  an  angle  D,  which  may  be  to  the  angle \nB  as  the  sine  of  the  angle  AOQ  to  the  radius ;  and  an  angle  E  which \nmay  be  to  the  angle  N  \u2014  AOQ  -fD  as  the  length  L  to  the  same  length \nL  diminished  by  the  cosine  of  the  angle  AOQ,  when  that  angle  is  less \nthan  a  right  angle,  or  increased  thereby  when  greater.", "e  AOQ,  when  that  angle  is  less \nthan  a  right  angle,  or  increased  thereby  when  greater. In  the  next \nplace,  take  an  angle  F  that  may  be  to  the  angle  B  as  the  sine  of  the  angle \n1OQ  H-  E  to  the  radius,  and  an  angle  G,  that  may  be  to  the  angle  N- \nAOQ  \u2014  E  -f  F  as  the  length  L  to  the  same  length  L  diminished  by  the \ncosine  of  the  angle  AOQ  +  E,  when  that  angle  is  less  than  a  right  angle, \nor  increased  thereby  when  greater. For  the  third  time  take  an  angle  H, \nthat  may  be  to  the  angle  B  as  the  sine  of  the  angle  AOQ  f-  E  4-  G  to  the \nradius;  and  an  angle  I  to  the  angle  N \u2014 AOQ  \u2014  E  \u2014  G  -f-  H,  as  the", "58  THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  jB(OK    1. length  L  is  to  the  same  length  L  diminished  by  the  cosine  of  the  angle \nAOQ  -f-  E  +  G,  when  that  angle  is  less  than  a  right  angle,  or  increased \nthereby  when  greater.

When  the  angle  N \u2014  AOQ,  -f  D  happens  to  be  negative,  the \nsign  -|-  of  the  angle  E  must  be  every  where  changed  into  \u2014 ,  and  the  sign  \u2014 \ninto  +. And  the  same  thing  is  to  be  understood  of  the  signs  of  the  angles \nG  and  I,  when  the  angles  N  \u2014  AOQ  \u2014  E  -f  F,  and  N  \u2014  AOQ  \u2014  E  \u2014 \nG  +  H  come  out  negative.

And  the  calculus  is  founded  upon \nthis  Theorem,  that  the  area  APS  is  as  the  difference  between  the  arc \nAQ  and  the  right  line  let  fall  from  the  focus  S  perpendicularly  upon  the \nradius  OQ.", "AQ  and  the  right  line  let  fall  from  the  focus  S  perpendicularly  upon  the \nradius  OQ.

Let  its  centre  be \nO,  its  vertex  A,  its  focus  S,  and  asymptote \nOK ;  and  suppose  the  quantity  of  the  area  to \nbe  cut  off  is  known,  as  being  proportional  to \nthe  time. Let  that  be  A,  and  by  conjecture \nsuppose  we  know  the  position  of  a  rij;ht  i  ne \nSP,  that  cuts  off  an  area  APS  near  the  truth.

And  by  repeating  the  computation  the  place  may  be  found \nperpetually  to  greater  and  greater  accuracy. And  by  such  computations  we  have  a  general \nanalytical  resolution  of  the  Problem. But  the  par \nticular  calculus  that  follows  is  better  fitted  for  as \ntronomical  purposes.

Find  also  an  angle  Z,  whose  sine  may  be  to  the  radius  as  the  double  rec \ntangle  under  the  distance  of  the  foci  SH  and  that  difference  D  to  triple \nthe  square  of  half  the  greater  semi-axis  AO. Those  angles  being  once \nfound,  the  place  of  the  body  may  be  thus  determined. Take  the  angle  T \nproportional  to  the  time  in  which  the  arc  BP  was  described,  or  equal  to \nwhat  is  called  the  mean  motion ;  and  an  angle  V  the  first  equation  of  thr \nmean  motion  to  the  angle  Y,  the  greatest  first  equation,  as  the  sine  of \ndouble  the  angle  T  is  to  the  radius ;  and  an  angle  X,  the  second  equation, \nto  the  angle  Z,  the  second  greatest  equation,  as  the  cube  of  the  sine  of  the \nangle  T  is  to  the  cube  of  the  radius. Then  take  the  angle  BHP  the  mean \nmotion  equated  equal  to  T  +  X  +  V,  the  sum  of  the  angles  T,  V.", "angle  BHP  the  mean \nmotion  equated  equal  to  T  +  X  +  V,  the  sum  of  the  angles  T,  V.

This  practice  seems  to  be  expeditious  enough,  because  the  angles  V  and \nX,  taken  in  second  minutes,  if  you  please,  being  very  small,  it  will  be  suf \nficient  to  find  two  or  three  of  their  first  figures. But  it  is  likewise \nsufficiently  accurate  to  answer  to  the  theory  of  the  planet's  motions. For  even  in  the  orbit  of  Mars,  where  the  greatest  equation  of  the  centre \namounts  to  ten  degrees,  the  error  will  scarcely  exceed  one  second. But \nwhen  the  angle  of  the  mean  motion  equated  BHP  is  found,  the  angle  oi \nthe  true  motion  BSP,  and  the  distance  SP,  are  readily  had  by  the  known \nmethods.

Let  a  body  descend  from  A  through  D  and  E,  to  the  centre \n(j :  and  let  another  body  move  from  V  in  the  curve  line  VIK&. From  the  centre  C,  with  any  distances,  describe  the  concentric \ncircles  DI,  EK,  meeting  the  right  line  AC  in  I)  and  E;  and \nthe  curve  VIK  in  I  and  K. Draw  1C  meeting  KE  in  N,  and \non  IK  let  fall  the  perpendicular  NT  \u2022  and  let  the  interval  DE \nor  IN  between  the  circumferences  of  the  circles  be  very  small ;  K/ \nand  imagine  the  bodies  in  D  and  I  to  have  equal  velocities. Then  because  the  distances  CD  and  CI  are  equal,  the  centri \npetal  forces  in  D  and  I  will  be  also  equal. Let  those  forces  be  k) \nexpressed  by  the  equal  lineoke  DE  and  IN ;  and  let  the  force \nIN  (by  Cor.", "rces  be  k) \nexpressed  by  the  equal  lineoke  DE  and  IN ;  and  let  the  force \nIN  (by  Cor. 2  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  be  resolved  into  two \nothers,  NT  and  IT. rl  hen  the  force  NT  acting  in  the  direction \nline  NT  perpendicular  to  the  path  ITK  of  the  body  will  not  at  all  affect \nor  change  the  velocity  of  the  body  in  that  path,  but  only  draw  it  aside \nfrom  a  rectilinear  course,  and  make  it  deflect  perpetually  from  the  tangent \nof  the  orbit,  and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path  ITK/j. That  whole \nforce,  therefore,  will  be  spent  in  producing  this  effect:  but  the  other  force \nIT,  acting  in  the  direction  of  the  course  of  the  body,  will  be  all  employed \nin  accelerating  it,  and  in  the  least  given  time  will  produce  an  acceleration \nproportional  to  itself. Therefore  the  accelerations  of  the  bodies  in  D  and \nI,  produced  in  equal  times,  are  as  the  lines  DE,  IT  (if  we  take  the  first \nratios  of  the  nascent  lines  DE,  IN,  IK,  IT,  NT) ;  and  in  unequal  times  as \nthose  lines  and  the  times  conjunctly.", "DE,  IN,  IK,  IT,  NT) ;  and  in  unequal  times  as \nthose  lines  and  the  times  conjunctly. But  the  times  in  which  DE  and  IK \nare  described,  are,  by  reason  of  the  equal  velocities  (in  D  and  I)  as  the \nspaces  described  DE  and  IK,  and  therefore  the  accelerations  in  the  course \nof  the  bodies  through  the  lines  DE  and  IK  are  as  DE  and  IT,  and  DE \nand  IK  conjunctly ;  that  is,  as  the  square  of  DE  to  the  rectangle  IT  into \nIK. But  the  rectangle  IT  X  IK  is  equal  to  the  square  of  IN,  that  is, \nequal  to  the  square  of  DE ;  and  therefore  the  accelerations  generated  in \nthe  passage  of  the  bodies  from  D  and  I  to  E  and  K  are  equal. Therefore \nthe  velocities  of  the  holies  in  E  and  K  are  also  equal,  and  by  the  same \nreasoning  they  will  always  be  found  equal  in  any  subsequent  equal  dis \ntances. Q..E.D.", "SEC. VI11.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 169 \nBy  the  same  reasoning,  bodies  of  equal  velocities  and  equal  distances \nfrom  the  centre  will  be  equally  retarded  in  their  ascent  to  equal  distances. Q.E.D. COR. 1. Therefore  if  a  body  either  oscillates  by  hanging  to  a  string,  or \nby  any  polished  and  perfectly  smooth  impediment  is  forced  to  move  in  a \ncurve  line  ;  and  another  body  ascends  or  descends  in  a  right  line,  and  their \nvelocities  be  equal  at  any  one  equal  altitude,  their  velocities  will  be  also \nequal  at  all  other  equal  altitudes. For  by  the  string  of  the  pendulous \nbody,  or  by  the  impediment  of  a  vessel  perfectly  smooth,  the  same  thing \nwill  be  effected  as  by  the  transverse  force  NT. The  body  is  neither \naccelerated  nor  retarded  by  it,  but  only  is  obliged  to  leave  its  rectilinear \ncourse. COR. 2. Suppose  the  quantity  P  to  be  the  greatest  distance  from  the \ncentre  to  which  a  body  can  ascend,  whether  it  be  oscillating,  or  revolving \nin  a  trajectory,  and  so  the  same  projected  upwards  from  any  point  of  a \ntrajectory  with  the  velocity  it  has  in  that  point.", "jected  upwards  from  any  point  of  a \ntrajectory  with  the  velocity  it  has  in  that  point.

Then \nthe  velocity  in  every  altitude  A  will  be  as  v/  P11  \u2014  A\",  and  therefore  will \nbe  given. For  by  Prop.

PROPOSITION  XLV. PROBLEM  XXXL \nTo  find  the  motion  of  the  apsides  in  orbits  approaching  very  near  to \ncircles. This  problem  is  solved  arithmetically  by  reducing  the  orbit,  which  a \nbody  revolving  in  a  movable  ellipsis  (as  in  Cor. 2  and  3  of  the  above \nProp.)  describes  in  an  immovable  plane,  to  the  figure  of  the  orbit  whose \napsides  are  required ;  and  then  seeking  the  apsides  of  the  orbit  which  that \nbody  describes  in  an  immovable  plane. But  orbits  acquire  the  same  figure, \nif  the  centripetal  forces  with  which  they  are  described,  compared  between \nthemselves,  are  made  proportional  at  equal  altitudes. Let  the  point  V  be \nthe  highest  apsis,  and  write  T  for  the  greatest  altitude  CV,  A  for  any  other \naltitude  CP  or  C/?,  and  X  for  the  difference  of  the  altitudes  C V  \u2014  CP : \nand  the  force  writh  which  a  body  moves  in  an  ellipsis  revolving  about  its \n\u2022p  -p       T?

This  will  be  made  plainer  by  Examples. EXAMPLE  1.

Now  since  the  orbit  is  supposed  extremely  near  to  a  circle,  let  it  coincide \nwith  a  circle ;  and  because  in  that  case  R  and  T  become  equal,  and  X  is \ninfinitely  diminished,  the  last  ratios  will  be,  as  RGG  to  T2,  so  \u2014  FF  to  \u2014 \n3TT,  or  as  GG  to  TT,  so  FF  to  3TT;  and  again,  as  GG  to  FF,  so  TT \nto  3TT,  that  is,  as  1  to  3  ;  and  therefore  G  is  to  F,  that  is,  the  angle  VC/? to  the  angle  VCP,  as  1  to  v/3. Therefore  since  the  body,  in  an  immovable", "178  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    I \nellipsis,  in  descending  from  the  upper  to  the  lower  apsis,  describes  an  angle, \nif  I  may  so  speak,  of  ISO  deg.,  the  other  body  in  a  movable  ellipsis,  and  there \nfore  in  the  immovable  orbit  we  are  treating  of,  will  in  its  descent  from \n180 \nthe  upper  to  the  lower  apsis,  describe  an  angle  VCjt? of  \u2014 ^  deg. And  this \n\\/o \ncomes  to  pass  by  reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a  body  acted \nupon  by  an  uniform  centripetal  force  describes,  and  of  that  orbit  which  a \nbody  performing  its  circuits  in  a  revolving  ellipsis  will  describe  in  a  quies \ncent  plane. By  this  collation  of  the  terms,  these  orbits  are  made  similar ; \nnot  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only  when  they  approach  very  near  to  a \ncircular  figure. A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform  centripetal \n180 \nforce  in  an  orbit  nearly  circular,  will  always  describe  an  angle  of  \u2014 \u00bb  deg/,  or \nv/o \n103  deg.,  55  m.,  23  sec.,  at  the  centre;  moving  from  the  upper  apsis  to  the \nlower  apsis  when  it  has  once  described  that  angle,  and  thence  returning  to \nthe  upper  apsis  when  it  has  described  that  angle  again ;  and  so  on  in  in- \nfinitwn.

And  conferring  these  terms \nwith  the  terms  of  the  other  numerator  RGG  \u2014 RFF  +  TFF  \u2014  FFX,  it \nbecomes  as  RGG  \u2014  RFF  4-  TFF  to  Tn,  so  \u2014  FF  to  \u2014  ?/.Tn\u2014 r  +  ?~^ \nXTn \u2014 2,  &c.

Therefore  since  the  angle  VCP,  described  in  the  de \nscent  of  the  body  from  the  upper  apsis  to  the  lower  apsis  in  an  ellipsis,  is \nof  180  deg.,  the  angle  VC/?,  described  in  the  descent  of  the  body  from  the \nupper  apsis  to  the  lower  apsis  in  an  orbit  nearly  circular  which  a  body  de \nscribes  with  a  centripetal  force  proportional  to  the  power  An \u2014 3,  will  be  equal \nISO \nto   an  angle  of  -  \u2014  deg.,  and  this  angle  being  repeated,  the  body  will  re- \n\\/ti \nturn  from  the  lower  to  the  upper  apsis,  and  so  on  in  infinitum.

Therefore  the  body  having  performed  a  fourth  part  of  one  revolution,  will \narrive  at  the  lower  apsis,  and  having  performed  another  fourth  part,  will \narrive  at  the  upper  apsis,  and  so  on  by  turns  in  infiuitum. This  appears \nalso  from  Prop. X. For  a  body  acted  on  by  this  centripetal  force  will  re \nvolve  in  an  immovable  ellipsis,  whose  centre  is  the  centre  of  force. If  the \n1       A2 \ncentripetal  force  is  reciprocally  as  the  distance,  that  is,  directly  as  \u2014  or  \u2014 \n\u00a3     '  A       A\"' \nji  will  be  equal  to  2 ;  and  therefore  the  angle  between  the  upper  and  lower \n180 \napsis  will  be  \u2014 -  deg.,  or  127  deg.,  16  min.,  45  sec. ;  and  therefore  a  body  re \nv/2 \nvolving  with  such  a  force,  will  by  a  perpetual  repetition  of  this  angle,  move \nalternately  from  the  upper  to  the  lower  and  from  the  lower  to  the  upper \napsis  for  ever.

Then  the  given  part  of  the  numerator  arising  from  that \noperation  is  to  be  supposed  in  the  same  ratio  to  that  part  of  it  which  is  not \ngiven,  as  the  given  part  of  this  numerator  RGG  \u2014  RFF  -f  TFF  \u2014  FFX. is  to  that  part  of  the  same  numerator  which  is  not  given.", "RGG  \u2014  RFF  -f  TFF  \u2014  FFX. is  to  that  part  of  the  same  numerator  which  is  not  given. And  taking \naway  the  superfluous  quantities,  and  writing  unity  for  T,  the  proportion \nof  G  to  F  is  obtained. COR. 1 . Hence  if  the  centripetal  force  be  as  any  power  of  the  altitude, \nthat  power  may  be  found  from  the  motion  of  the  apsides ;  and  so  contra \nriwise. That  is,  if  the  whole  angular  motion,  with  which  the  body  returns \nto  the  same  apsis,  be  to  the  angular  motion  of  one  revolution,  or  360  deg., \nMS  any  number  as  m  to  another  as  n,  and  the  altitude  called  A ;  the  force \nnn \nwill  be  as  the  power  A  HSii  \u2014 3  of  the  altitude  A;  the  index  of  which  power  is \n-  \u2014  3. This  appears  by  the  second  example. Hence  it  is  plain  that \nthe  force  in  its  recess  from  the  centre  cannot  decrease  in  a  greater  than  a \ntriplicate  ratio  of  the  altitude. A  body  revolving  with  such  a  force,  and \nparting  from  the  apsis,  if  it  once  begins  to  descend,  can  never  arrive  at  the \nlower  apsis  or  least  altitude,  but  will  descend  to  the  centre,  describing  the \ncurve  line  treated  of  in  Cor. 3,  Prop.", "but  will  descend  to  the  centre,  describing  the \ncurve  line  treated  of  in  Cor. 3,  Prop.

So  that  where \nthe  force  in  its  recess  from  the  centre  decreases  in  a  greater  than  a  tripli \ncate  ratio  of  the  altitude,  the  body  at  its  parting  from  the  apsis,  will  either \ndescend  to  the  centre,  or  ascend  in  iiiftnitum,  according  as  it  descends  or \nAscends  at  the  beginning  of  its  motion. But  if  the  force  in  its  recess  from", "\"SEC. IX.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. ISi \nthe  centre  either  decreases  in  a  less  than  a  triplicate  ratio  of  the  altitude, \nor  increases  in  any  ratio  of  the  altitude  whatsoever,  the  body  will  never \ndescend  to  the  centre,  but  will  at  some  time  arrive  at  the  lower  apsis  ;  and, \non  the  contrary,  if  the  body  alternately  ascending  and  descending  from  one \napsis  to  another  never  comes  to  the  centre,  then  either  the  force  increases \nin  the  recess  from  the  centre,  or  it  decreases  in  a  less  than  a  triplicate  ratio \nof  the  altitude;  and  the  sooner  the  body  returns  from  one  apsis  to  another, \nthe  farther  is  the  ratio  of  the  forces  from  the  triplicate  ratio.

If  the \nbody  in  three  fourth  parts,  or  two  thirds,  or  one  third,  or  one  fourth  part \nof  an  entire  revolution,  return  to  the  same  apsis  ;  m  will  be  to  n  as  \u00a3  or  ? n  n  i_6  _  3  9  _  3  o \nor  ^  or  i  to  1,  and  therefore  Amm     3  is  equal  to  A  9        'or  A4         or  A \n_  3  1  6  _  3  l_l \n'  '  or  A  ;  and  therefore  the  force  is  either  reciprocally  as  A  fl      or \n3  613 \nA4'  or  directly  as  A  or  A  . Lastly  if  the  body  in  its  progress  from  the \nupper  apsis  to  the  same  upper  apsis  again,  goes  over  one  entire  revolution \nand  three  deg. more,  and  therefore  that  apsis  in  each  revolution  of  the  body \nmoves  three  deg. in  consequentia  ;  then  m  will  be  to  u  as  363  deg. to \n360  deg.", "body \nmoves  three  deg. in  consequentia  ;  then  m  will  be  to  u  as  363  deg. to \n360  deg. or  as   121   to   120,  and  therefore   Amm  will   be    equal    to \n  2  9_  5_  2_  JJ \nA  \"'  and   therefore  the  centripetal  force   will    be   reciprocally  as \n^T4\"6TT>  or  reciprocally  as  A2^4^  very  nearly.

Hence  also  if  a  body,  urged  by  a  centripetal  force  which  is  re \nciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  altitude,  revolves  in  an  ellipsis  whose  focus \nis  in  the  centre  of  the  forces ;  and  a  new  and  foreign  force  should  be  added \nto  or  subducted  from  this  centripetal  force,  the  motion  of  the  apsides  arising \nfrom  that  foreign  force  may  (by  the  third  Example)  be  known ;  and  so  on \nthe  contrary.

For  the  force  with  which  the  body  P  is  urged  to \nthe  body  T  at  the  quadratures,  where  the  force  MN  vanishes,  is  compound \ned  of  the  force  LM  and  the  centripetal  force  with  which  the  body  T  at \ntracts  the  body  P. The  first  force  LM,  if  the  distance  PT  be  increased,  is \nincreased  in  nearly  the  same  proportion  with  that  distance,  and  the  other \nforce  decreases  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  distance ;  and  therefore  the \nsum  of  these  two  forces  decreases  in  a  less  than  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the \ndistance  PT ;  and  therefore,  by  Cor. 1,  Prop.

Therefore  the  orbit  by  the  accession  of  this  new  force  will \nbecome  more  eccentrical. If  now,  while  the  body  is  returning  from  the \nlower  to  the  upper  apsis,  it  should  decrease  by  the  same  degrees  by  which \nit  increases  before  the  body  would  return  to  its  first  distance;  and  there-", "THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    I. fore  if  the  force  decreases  in  a  yet  greater  ratio,  the  body,  being  now  less \nattracted  than  before,  will  ascend  to  a  still  greater  distance,  and  so  the  ec \ncentricity  of  the  orbit  will  be  increased  still  more. Therefore  if  the  ratio \nof  the  increase  and  decrease  of  the  centripetal  force  be  augmented  each \nrevolution,  the  eccentricity  will  be  augmented  also ;  and,  on  the  contrary, \nif  that  ratio  decrease,  it  will  be  diminished.

For  that  the  attraction  is  infinitely  increased  when  the  attracted  corpus \ncle  comes  to  touch  an  attracting  sphere  of  this  kind,  appears,  by  the  solu \ntion  of  Problem  XLI,  exhibited  in  \u00a3\u00a3e  second  and  third  Examples.

Therefore  if  the  body  goes \nfrom  the  place  F,  with  a  due  velocity,  in  the  direction  of  a  line  parallel  to \nPQ,  and  the  density  of  the  medium  in  each  of  the  places  H  is  as  the  length \nof  the  tangent  HT,  and  the  resistance  also  in  any  place  H  is  to  the  force \nof  gravity  as  SAC  to  PQ,  that  body  will  describe  the  quadrant  FHQ  of  a \ncircle.

But  nature \ndoes  not  admit  of  a  negative  density,  that  is,  a  density  which  accelerates \nthe  motion  of  bodies;  and  therefore  it  cannot  naturally  come  to  pass  that \na  body  by  ascending  from  P  should  describe  the  quadrant  PF  of  a  circle. To  produce  such  an  effect,  a  body  ought  to  be  accelerated  by  an  impelling \nmedium,  and  not  impeded  by  a  resisting  one. EXAMPLE  2.

Because  there  can  be  no  motion  in  a  para \nbola  except  in  a  non-resisting  medium,  but \nin  the  hyperbolas  here  described  it  is  produced \nby  a  perpetual  resistance ;  it  is  evident  that \nthe  line  which  a  projectile  describes  in  an \nuniformly  resisting  medium  approaches  nearer \nto  these  hyperbolas  than  to  a  parabola.

The  difference,  however,  is  not  so  great  between \nthe  one  and  the  other  but  that  these  latter  may  be  commod^ously  enough \nused  in  practice  instead  of  the  former. And  perhaps  these  may  prove  more \nuseful  than  an  hyperbola  that  is  more  accurate,  and  at  the  same  time  more \ncompounded.

Therefore  if  those  lengths,  in  any", "276  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    II. one  case,  are  found,  the  hyperbola  may  afterwards  be  easily  determined \nfrom  any  given  angle  NAH. RULE  2. If  the  angle  NAH,  and  the  density  of  the  medium  at  A,  re \nmain  the  same,  and  the  velocity  with  which  the  body  is  projected  be \nchanged,  the  length  AH  will  continue  the  same  ;  and  AI  will  be  changed \nin  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity  reciprocally. RULE  3. If  the  angle  NAH,  the  velocity  of  the  body  at  A,  and  the  ac- \ncelerative  gravity  remain  the  same,  and  the  proportion  of  the  resistance  at \nA  to  the  motive  gravity  be  augmented  in  any  ratio  ;  the  proportion  of  AH \nto  A I  will  be  augmented  in  the  same  ratio,  the  latus  rectum  of  the  above- \nAH2 \nmentioned  parabola  remaining  the  same,  and  also  the  length  propor- \nAI \ntional  to  it ;  and  therefore  AH  will  be  diminished  in  the  same  ratio,  and \nAI  will  be  diminished  in  the  duplicate  of  that  ratio.", "minished  in  the  same  ratio,  and \nAI  will  be  diminished  in  the  duplicate  of  that  ratio. But  the  proportion \nof  the  resistance  to  the  weight  is  augmented,  when  either  the  specific  grav \nity  is  made  less,  the  magnitude  remaining  equal,  or  when  the  density  of \nthe  medium  is  made  greater,  or  when,  by  diminishing  the  magnitude,  the \nresistance  becomes  diminished  in  a  less  ratio  than  the  weight. RULE  4. Because  the  density  of  the  medium  is  greater  near  the  vertex \nof  the  hyperbola  than  it  is  in  the  place  A,  that  a  mean  density  may  be \npreserved,  the  ratio  of  the  least  of  the  tangents  GT  to  the  tangent  AH \nought  to  be  found,  and  the  density  in  A  augmented  in  a  ratio  a  little \ngreater  than  that  of  half  the  sum  of  those  tangents  to  the  least  of  the \ntangents  GT.

By  how  much  the  greater  the  number  n  is,  so  much  the  more \naccurate  are  these  hyperbolas  in  the  ascent  of  the  body  from  A,  and  less \naccurate  in  its  descent  to  K ;  and  the  contrary. The  conic  hyperbola \nkeeps  a  mean  ratio  between  these,  and  is  more  simple  than  the  rest.

If  the \nratio  of  AK  to  A/.*  bo  the  same  with  that  of  d  to  e,  the  length  of  AH  was \nrightly  assumed. If  not,  take  on  the  indefinite  right  line  SM,  the  length \nSM  equal  to  the  assumed  AH ;  and  erect  a  perpendicular  MN  equal  to  the \nAK      d \ndifference  -r-r   of  the  ratios  drawn  into  any  given  right  line. By  the \nlike  method,  from  several  assumed  lengths  AH,  you  may  find  several  points \nN  ;  and  draw  througli  them  all  a  regular  curve  NNXN,  cutting  tr.e  right \nline  SMMM  in  X. Lastly,  assume  AH  equal  to  the  abscissa  SX,  and \nthence  find  again  the  length  AK ;  and  the  lengths,  w'hich  are  to  the  as \nsumed  length  AI,  and  this  last  AH,  as  the  length  AK  known  by  experi \nment,  to  the  length  AK  last  found,  will  be  the  true  lengths  AI  and  AH, \nwhich  were  to  be  found.

A  fluid  is  any  body  whose  parts  yield  to  any  force  impressed  on  it, \nby  yielding,  are  easily  moved  among  themselves. PROPOSITION  XIX. THEOREM  XIv \nAll  the  parts  of  a  homogeneous  and  unmoved  fluid  included  in  any  un \nmoved  vessel,  and  compressed  on  every  side  (setting  aside  the  consider \nation  of  condensation,   gravity,   and   all  centripetal  forces],   will  be \nequally  pressed  on  every  side,  and  remain  in  their  places  without  any \nmotion  arising  from  that  pressure. CASE  1. Let  a  fluid  be  included  in  the  spherical \nvessel   ABC,  and  uniformly  compressed  on  every \nside :  1  say,  that  no  part  of  it  will  be  moved  by \nthat  pressure. For  if  any  part,  as  L),  be  moved, \nall  such  parts  at  the  same  distance  from  the  centre \non   every  side  must  necessarily  be  moved   at   the \nsame  time  by  a  like  motion ;  because  the  pressure \nof  them  all  is  similar  and  equal ;  and  all  other \nmotion  is  excluded  that  does  not  arise  from  that \npressure.", "and  equal ;  and  all  other \nmotion  is  excluded  that  does  not  arise  from  that \npressure. But  if  these  parts  come  all  of  them  nearer  to  the  centre,  the \nfluid   must  be  condensed  towards  the  centre,  contrary  to  the  supposition. If  they  recede  from  it,  the  fluid  must  be  condensed  towards  the  circumfer \nence  ;  which  is  also  contrary  to  the  supposition. Neither   can  they  move \nin  any  one  direction  retaining  their  distance   from  the  centre,  because  for \nthe  same  reason,  they  may  move  in  a  contrary  direction  :  but   the  sami \npart  cannot  be  moved   contrary  ways  at  the  same   time. Therefore  no \npart  of  the  fluid  will  be  moved  from  its  place. Q,.E.T). CASE  2. I  say  now,  that  all  the  spherical  parts  of  this  fluid  are  equally \npressed  on  every  side. For  let  EF  be  a  spherical  part  of  the  fluid  ;  if  this \nbe  not  pressed  equally  on  every  side,  augment  the  lesser  pressure  till  it  be \npressed  equally  on  every  side;  and  its  parts  (by  Case  I)  will  remain  in \ntheir  places. But  before  the  increase  of  the  pressure,  they  would  remain \nin  their  places  (by  Case  1) ;  and  by  the  addition  of  a  new  pressure  they \nwill  be  moved,  by  the  definition  of  a  fluid,  from  those  places.", "a  new  pressure  they \nwill  be  moved,  by  the  definition  of  a  fluid,  from  those  places. Now  these \ntwo  conclusions  contradict  each  other. Therefore  it  was  false  to  say  that \nthe  sphere  EF  was  not  pressed  equally  on  every  side. Q,.E.D. CASE  3. I  say  besides,  that  different  spherical  parts  have  equal  pressures. For  the  contiguous  spherical  parts  press  each  other  mutually  and  equally \nin  the  point  of  contact  (by  Law  III). But  (by  Case  2)  they  are  pressed  on \nevery  side  with  the  same  force. Therefore  any  two  spherical  parts  lot", "391  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    II. contiguous,  since  an  intermediate  spherical  part  can  touch  both,  will  be \npressed  with  the  same  force. Q.E.D. CASE  4. I  say  now,  that  all  the  parts  of  the  fluid  are  every  where  press \ned  equally. For  any  two  parts  may  be  touched  by  spherical  parts  in  any \npoints  whatever ;  and  there  they  will  equally  .press  those  spherical  parts \n(by  Case  3). and  are  reciprocally  equally  pressed  by  them  (by  Law  III). Q.E.D. CASE  5. Since,  therefore,  any  part  GHI  of  the  fluid  is  inclosed  by  the \nrest  of  the  fluid  as  in  a  vessel,  and  is  equally  pressed  on  every  side  ;  and \nalso  its  parts  equally  press  one  another,  and  are  at  rest  among  themselves ; \nit  is  manifest  that  all  the  parts  of  any  fluid  as  GHI,  which  is  pressed \nequally  on  every  side,  do  press  each  other  mutually  and  equally,  and  are  at \nrest  among  themselves. Q.E.D. CASE  6. Therefore  if  that  fluid  be  included  in  a  vessel  of  a  yielding \nsubstance,  or  that  is  not  rigid,  and  be  not  equally  pressed  on  every  side, \nthe  same  will  give  way  to  a  stronger  pressure,  by  the  Definition  of  fluidity. CASE  7.", "the  same  will  give  way  to  a  stronger  pressure,  by  the  Definition  of  fluidity. CASE  7. And  therefore,  in  an  inflexible  or  rigid  vessel,  a  fluid  will  not \nSustain  a  stronger  pressure  on  one  side  than  on  the  other,  but  will  give \nway  to  it,  and  that  in  a  moment  of  time ;  because  the  rigid  side  of  the \nvessel  does  not  follow  the  yielding  liquor. But  the  fluid,  by  thus  yielding, \nwill  press  against  the  opposite  side,  and  so  the  pressure  will  tend  on  every \nside  to  equality. And  because  the  fluid,  as  soon  as  it  endeavours  to  recede \nfrom  the  part  that  is  most  pressed,  is  withstood  by  the  resistance  of  the \nvessel  on  the  opposite  side,  the  pressure  will  on  every  side  be  reduced  to \nequality,  in  a  moment  of  time,  without  any  local  motion  :  and  from  thence \nthe  parts  of  the  fluid  (by  Case  5)  will  press  each  other  mutually  and  equal \nly,  and  be  at  rest  among  themselves. Q..E.D. COR.", "l  press  each  other  mutually  and  equal \nly,  and  be  at  rest  among  themselves. Q..E.D. COR. Whence  neither  will  a  motion  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  among \nthemselves  be  changed  by  a  pressure  communicated  to  the  external  super \nficies,  except  so  far  as  either  the  figure  of  the  superficies  may  be  somewhere \naltered,  or  that  all  the  parts  of  the  fluid,  by  pressing  one  another  more  in \ntensely  or  remissly,  may  slide  with  more  or  less  difficulty  among  them \nselves. PROPOSITION  XX. THEOREM  XV. Jf  all  the  parts  of  a  spherical  fluid,  homogeneous  at  equal  distances  from \nthe  centre,  lying  on. a  spherical  concentric  bottom,  gravitate  towards \nthe  centre  of  the  whole,  the  bottom  will  sustain  the  weight  of  a  cylin \nder,  whose  base  is  equal  to  the  superficies  of  the  bottom,  and  whose  al \ntitude  is  the  same  with  that  of  the  incumbent  fluid. Let  OHM  be  the  superficies  of  the  bottom,  and  AEI  the  upper  super \nficies  of  the  fluid. Let  the  fluid  be  distinguished  into  concentric  orbs  of \n3qual  thickness,  by  the  innumerable  spherical  superficies  *3PK,  CGL  :  and", "SEC. V  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 295 \nconceive  the  force  of  gravity  to  act  only  in  the \nupper  superficies  of  every  orb,  and  the  actions \nto  be  equal  on  the  equal  parts  of  all  the  su \nperficies. Therefore  the  upper  superficies  AE \nis  pressed  by  the  single  force  of  its  own  grav \nity,  by  which  all  the  parts  of  the  upper  orb, \nand  the  second  superficies  BFK,  will  (by \nProp. XIX),  according  to  its  measure,  be \nequally  pressed. The  second  superficies  BFK \nis  pressed  likewise  by  the  force  of  its  own \ngravity,  which,  added  to  the  former  force, \nmakes  the  pressure  double. The  third  superficies  CGL  is,  according  to  its \nmeasure,  acted  on  by  this  pressure  and  the  force  of  its  own  gravity  besides, \nwhich  makes  its  pressure  triple. And  in  like  manner  the  fourth  superfi \ncies  receives  a  quadruple  pressure,  the  fifth  superficies  a  quintuple,  and  so \non.", "perfi \ncies  receives  a  quadruple  pressure,  the  fifth  superficies  a  quintuple,  and  so \non. Therefore  the  pressure  acting  on  every  superficies  is  not  as  the  solid \nquantity  of  the  incumbent  fluid,  but  as  the  number  of  the  orbs  reaching \nto  the  upper  surface  of  the  fluid  ;  and  is  equal  to  the  gravity  of  the  lowest \norb  multiplied  by  the  number  of  orbs :  that  is,  to  the  gravity  of  a  solid \nwhose  ultimate  ratio  to  the  cylinder  above-mentioned  (when  the  number  of \nthe  orbs  is  increased  and  their  thickness  diminished,  ad  infiititum,  so  that \nthe  action  of  gravity  from  the  lowest  superficies  to  the  uppermost  may  be- \nsome  continued)  is  the  ratio  of  equality. Therefore  the  lowest  superficies \n\u2022sustains  the  weight  of  the  cylinder  above  determined. Q..E.D. And  by  a \nlike  reasoning  the  Proposition  will  be  evident,  where  the  gravity  of  the \nfluid  decreases  in  any  assigned  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  centre,  and \nalso  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below. Q.E.D. COR. 1.", "he  centre,  and \nalso  where  the  fluid  is  more  rare  above  and  denser  below. Q.E.D. COR. 1. Therefore  the  bottom  is  not  pressed  by  the  whole  weight  of  the \nincumbent  fluid,  but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it  which  is  described  in  the \nProposition  ;  the  rest  of  the  weight  being  sustained  archwise  by  the  spheri \ncal  figure  of  the  fluid. COR. 2. The  quantity  of  the  pressure  is  the  same  always  at  equal  dis \ntances  from  the  centre,  whether  the  superficies  pressed  be  parallel  to  the \nhorizon,  or  perpendicular,  or  oblique ;  or  whether  the  fluid,  continued  up \nwards  from  the  compressed  superficies,  rises  perpendicularly  in  a  rectilinear \ndirection,  or  creeps  obliquely  through  crooked  cavities  and  canals,  whether \nthose  passages  be  regular  or  irregular,  wide  or  narrow. That  the  pressure \nis  not  altered  by  any  of  these  circumstances,  may  be  collected  by  applying \nthe  demonstration  of  this  Theorem  to  the  several  cases  of  fluids. COR. 3. From  the  same  demonstration  it  may  also  be  collected  (by  Prop. XIX),  that  the  parts  of  a  heavy  fluid  acquire  no  motion  among  themselvei \nby  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  veight,  except  that  motion  which  arises \nfrom  condensation.", "296  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BCOK    II \nCon. 4. And  therefore  if  another  body  of  the  same  specific  gravity,  in \ncapable  of  condensation,  be  immersed  in  this  fluid,  it  will  acquire  no  mo \ntion  by  the  pressure  of  the  incumbent  weight:  it  will  neither  descend  nor  . ascend,  nor  change  its  figure. If  it  be  spherical,  it  will  remain  so,  notwith \nstanding  the  pressure  ;  if  it  be  square,  it  will  remain  square;  and  that, \nwhether  it  be  soft  or  fluid :  whether  it  swims  freely  in  the  fluid,  or  lies  at \nthe  bottom. For  any  internal  part  of  a  fluid  is  in  the  same  state  with  the \nsubmersed  body  ;  and  the  case  of  all  submersed  bodies  that  have  the  same \nmagnitude,  figure,  and  specific  gravity,  is  alike. If  a  submersed  body,  re \ntaining  its  weight,  should  dissolve  and  put  on  the  form  of  a  fluid,  this \nbody,  if  before  it  would  have  ascended,  descended,  or  from  any  pressure  as \nsume  a  new  figure,  would  now  likewise  ascend,  descend,  or  put  on  a  new \nfigure  ;  and  that,  because  its  gravity  and  the  other  causes  of  its  motion \nremain. But  (by  Case  5,  Prop. XIX;  it  would  now  be  at  rest,  and  retain \nits  figure. Therefore  also  in  the  former  case. COR. 5.", "would  now  be  at  rest,  and  retain \nits  figure. Therefore  also  in  the  former  case. COR. 5. Therefore  a  body  that  is  specifically  heavier  than  a  fluid  con \ntiguous  to  it  will  sink ;  and  that  which  is  specifically  lighter  will  ascend, \nand  attain  so  much  motion  and  change  of  figure  as  that  excess  or  defect  of \ngravity  is  able  to  produce. For  that  excess  or  defect  is  the  same  thing  as  an \nimpulse,  by  which  a  body,  otherwise  in  equilibria  with  the  parts  of  the \nfluid,  is  acted  on:  and  may  be  compared  with  the  excess  or  defect  of  a \nweight  in  one  of  the  scales  of  a  balance. COR. 6. Therefore  bodies  placed  in  fluids  have  a  twofold  gravity  \u2022  the \none  true  and  absolute,  the  other  apparent,  vulgar,  and  comparative. Ab \nsolute  gravity  is  the  whole  force  with  which  the  body  tends  downwards ; \nrelative  and  vulgar  gravity  is  the  excess  of  gravity  with  which  the  body \ntends  downwards  more  than  the  ambient  fluid. By  the  first  kind  of  grav \nity  the  parts  of  all  fluids  and  bodies  gravitate  in  their  proper  places ;  and \ntherefore  their  weights  taken  together  compose  the  weight  of  the  whole.", "er  places ;  and \ntherefore  their  weights  taken  together  compose  the  weight  of  the  whole. For  the  whole  taken  together  is  heavy,  as  may  be  experienced  in  vessels \nfull  of  liquor  ;  and  the  weight  of  the  whole  is  equal  to  the  weights  of  all \nthe  parts,  and  is  therefore  composed  of  them. By  the  other  kind  of  grav \nity  bodies  do  not  gravitate  in  their  places ;  that  is,  compared  with  one \nanother,  they  do  not  preponderate,  but,  hindering  one  another's  endeavours \nto  descend,  remain  in  their  proper  places,  as  if  they  were  not  heavy. Those \nthings  which  are  in  the  air,  and  do  not  preponderate,  are  commonly  looked \non  as  not  heavy. Those  which  do  preponderate  are  commonly  reckoned \nheavy,  in  as  much  as  they  are  not  sustained  by  the  weight  of  the  air. The \nCommon  weights  are  nothing  else  but  the  excess  of  the  true  weights  above \nthe  weight  of  the  air. Hence  also,  vulgarly,  those  things  are  called  light \nwhich  are  less  heavy,  and,  by  yielding  to  the  preponderating  air,  mount \nupwards. But  these  are  only  comparatively  lig  s  &mA  not  truly  so,  because \nhey  descend  in  racuo. Thus,  in  water,  bodies  *>icfc. by  their  greater  or", "SEC. V.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 297 \nless  gravity,  descend  or  ascend,  are  comparatively  and  apparently  heavy  or \nlight ;  and  their  comparative  and  apparent  gravity  or  levity  is  the  excess \n.or  defect  by  which  their  true  gravity  either  exceeds  the  gravity  of  the \nwater  or  is  exceeded  by  it. But  those  things  which  neither  by  preponder \nating  descend,  nor,  by  yielding  to  the  preponderating  fluid,  ascend,  although \nby  their  true  weight  they  do  increase  the  weight  of  the  whole,  yet  com \nparatively,  and  in  the  sense  of  the  vulgar,  they  do  not  gravitate  in  the  wa \nter. For  these  cases  are  alike  demonstrated. COR. 7. These  things  which  have  been  demonstrated  concerning  gravity \ntake  place  in  any  other  centripetal  forces. COR. 8. Therefore  if  the  medium  in  which  any  body  moves  be  acted  on \neither  by  its  own  gravity,  or  by  any  other  centripetal  force,  and  the  body \nbe  urged  more  powerfully  by  the  same  force  ;  the  difference  of  the  forces  is \nthat  very  motive  force,  which,  in  the  foregoing  Propositions,  I  have  con \nsidered  as  a  centripetal  force. But  if  the  body  be  more  lightly  urged  by \nthat  force,  the  difference  of  the  forces  becomes  a  centrifugal  force,  and  is  tc \nbe  considered  as  such. COR. 9.", "ce  of  the  forces  becomes  a  centrifugal  force,  and  is  tc \nbe  considered  as  such. COR. 9. But  since  fluids  by  pressing  the  included  bodies  do  not \nchange  their  external  figures,  it  appears  also  (by  Cor. Prop. XIX)  that  they \nwill  not  change  the  situation  of  their  internal  parts  in  relation  to  onf \nanother ;  and  therefore  if  animals  were  immersed  therein,  and  that  all  sen \nsation  did  arise  from  the  motion  of  their  parts,  the  fluid  will  neither  hurt \nthe  immersed  bodies,  nor  excite  any  sensation,  unless  so  far  as  those  bodies \nmay  be  condensed  by  the  compression. And  the  case  is  the  same  of  any \nsystem  of  bodies  encompassed  with  a  compressing  fluid. All  the  parts  of \nthe  system  will  be  agitated  with  the  same  motions  as  if  they  were  placed \nin  a  vacuum,  and  would  only  retain  their  comparative  gravity  ;  unless  so \nfar  as  the  fluid  may  somewhat  resist  their  motions,  or  be  requisite  to  con- \nglutinate  them  by  compression.

We  have  an  example  of  this  in  magnetical  bodies. Their  attractive  vir \ntue  is  terminated  nearly  in  bodies  of  their  own  kind  that  are  next  them. The  virtue  of  the  magnet  is  contracted  by  the  interposition  of  an  iron \nplate,  and  is  almost  terminated  at  it :  for  bodies  further  off  are  not  attracted \nby  the  magnet  so  much  as  by  the  iron  plate.

XXVIII  is  demonstrated. If  the  resistance  be  as  the  velocity,  the  figure  BKTa  will  be  nearly  an \nellipsis. For  if  a  body,  in  a  non-resisting  medium,  by  one  entire  oscilla \ntion,  should  describe  the  length  BA,  the  velocity  in  any  place  D  would  be \nas  the  ordinate  DE  of  the  circle  described  on  the  diameter  AB. There \nfore  since  Ea  in  the  resisting  medium,  and  BA  in  the  non-resisting  one, \nare  described  nearly  in  the  same  times ;  and  therefore  the  velocities  in  each \nof  the  points  of  Ba  are  to  the  velocities  in  the  correspondent  points  of  the \nlength  BA. nearly  as  Ba  is  to  BA ,  the  velocity  in  the  point  D  in  the  re-", "312 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BJOK    11. sisting  medium  will  be  as  the  ordinate  of  the  circle  or  ellipsis  described \nupon  the  diameter  Ba  ;  and  therefore  the  figure  BKVTa  will  be  nearly  ac \nellipsis. Since  the  resistance  is  supposed  proportional  to  the  velocity,  le\\ \nOV  be  the  exponent  of  the  resistance  in  the  middle  point  O  ;  and  an  ellip \nsis  BRVSa  described  with  the  centre  O,  and  the  semi-axes  OB,  OV,  will \nbe  nearly  equal  to  the  figure  BKVTa,  and  to  its  equal  the  rectangle  Act \nX  BO. Therefore  Aa  X  BO  is  to  OV  X  BO  as  the  area  of  this  ellipsis \nto  OV  X  BO;  that  is,  Aa  is  to  OV  as  the  area  of  the  semi-circle  to  the \nsquare  of  the  radius,  or  as  1 1  to  7  nearly  ;  and,  therefore,  T7T Aa  is  to  the \nlength  of  the  pendulum  as  the  resistance  of  the  oscillating  body  in  O  to \nits  gravity. Now  if  the  resistance  DK  be  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity,  the \nfigure  BKVTa  will  be  almost  a  parabola  having  V  for  its  vertex  arid  OV \nfor  its  axis,  and  therefore  will  be  nearly  equal  to  the  rectangle  under  f  Ba \nand  OV.", "for  its  axis,  and  therefore  will  be  nearly  equal  to  the  rectangle  under  f  Ba \nand  OV. Therefore  the  rectangle  under  |Ba  and  Aa  is  equal  to  the  rec \ntangle  f  Ba  X  OV,  and  therefore  OV  is  equal  to  f  Aa  ;  and  therefore  the \nresistance  in  O  made  to  the  oscillating  body  is  to  its  gravity  as  f  Aa  to  the \nlength  of  the  pendulum. And  I  take  these  conclusions  to  be  accurate  enough  for  practical  uses. For  since  an  ellipsis  or  parabola  BRVSa  falls  in  with  the  figure  BKVTa \nin  the  middle  point  V,  that  figure,  if  greater  towards  the  part  BRV  or \nVSa  than  the  other,  is  less  towards  the  contrary  part,  and  is  therefore \nnearly  equal  to  it. PROPOSITION  XXXI. THEOREM  XXV. If  the  resistance  made  to  an  oscillating  body  in  each  of  the  proportional \nparts  of  the  arcs  described  be  augmented  or  diminished  in,  a  given  ra \ntio,  the  difference  between  the  arc  described  in  the  descent  and  the  arc \ndescribed  in  the  subsequent  ascent  ivill  be  augmented  or  diminished  in \nthe  same  ratio.

GENERAL  SCHOLIUM. From  these  propositions  we  may  find  the  resistance  of  mediums  by  pen \ndulums  oscillating  therein. I  found  the  resistance  of  the  air  by  the  fol \nlowing  experiments. I  suspended  a  wooden  globe  or  ball  weighing  oT^ \nounces  troy,  its  diameter  CJ  London  inches,  by  a  fine  thread  on  a  firm \nhook,  so  that  the  distance  between  the  hook  and  the  centre  of  oscillation  of \nthe  globe  was  10|  feet. I  marked  on  the  thread  a  point  10  feet  and  1  inch \ndistant  from  the  centre  of  suspension  \u2022  and  even  with  that  point  I  placed  a \nruler  divided  into  inches,  by  the  help  whereof  I  observed  the  lengths  of  the \narcs  described  by  the  pendulum. Then  I  numbered  the  oscillations  ia \nwhich  the  globe  would  lose  -{-  part  of  its  motion.", "hen  I  numbered  the  oscillations  ia \nwhich  the  globe  would  lose  -{-  part  of  its  motion. If  the  pendulum  was \ndrawn  aside  from  the  perpendicular  to  the  distance  of  2  inches,  and  thence \nlet  go,  so  that  in  its  whole  descent  it  described  an  arc  of  2  inches,  and  in \nthe  first  whole  oscillation,  compounded  of  the  descent  and  subsequent \nascent,  an  arc  of  almost  4  inches,  the  same  in  164  oscillations  lost  j  part \nof  its  motion,  so  as  in  its  last  ascent  to  describe  an  arc  of  If  inches. If \nin  the  first  descent  it  described  an  arc  of  4  inches,  it  lost  j  part  of  its  mo \ntion  in  121  oscillations,  so  as  in  its  last  ascent  to  describe  an  arc  of  3^ \ninches. If  in  the  first  descent  it  described  an  arc  of  8, 16,  32,  or  64  inches, \nit  lost  |  part  of  its  motion  in  69,  35|,  18|-7  9|  oscillations,  respectively. Therefore  the  difference  between  the  arcs  described  in  the  first  descent  and \nthe  last  ascent  was  in  the  1st,  2d,  3d,  4th,  5th,  6th  cases,  },  1. 1,  2,  4,  8 \ninches  respectively. Divide  those  differences  by  the  number  of  oscillations \nin  each  case,  and  in  one  mean  oscillation,  wherein  an  arc  of  3\u00a3 ,  7-|,  15,  30", "314  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    Jl. 60,  120  inches  was  described,  the  difference  of  the  arcs  described  in  the \ndescent  and  subsequent  ascent  will  be  \u00a5|^,  ^{^  e\\>  T4r;  -sji  fir  parts  of  an \ninch,  respectively. But  these  differences  in  the  greater  oscillations  are  in \nthe  duplicate  ratio  of  the  arcs  described  nearly,  but  in  lesser  oscillations \nsomething  greater  than  in  that  ratio  ;  and  therefore  (by  Cor. 2,  Prop. XXXI \nof  this  Book)  the  resistance  of  the  globe,  when  it  moves  very  swift,  is  in \nthe  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity,  nearly;  and  when  it  moves  slowly, \nsomewhat  greater  than  in  that  ratio. Now  let  V  represent  the  greatest  velocity  in  any  oscillation,  and  let  A, \nB,  and  C  be  given  quantities,  and  let  us  suppose  the  difference   of  the  arcs \n3^ \nto  be  AV  +  BV2  +  CV2.", "quantities,  and  let  us  suppose  the  difference   of  the  arcs \n3^ \nto  be  AV  +  BV2  +  CV2. Since  the  greatest  velocities  are  in  the  cycloid \nas  ^  the  arcs  described  in  oscillating,  and  in  the  circle  as  |  the  chords  of \nthose  arcs ;  and  therefore  in  equal  arcs  are  greater  in  the  cycloid  than  in \nthe  circle  in  the  ratio  of  |  the  arcs  to  their  chords ;  but  the  times  in  the \ncircle  are  greater  than  in  the  cycloid,  in  a  reciprocal  ratio  of  the  velocity ; \nit  is  plain  that  the  differences  of  the  arcs  (which  are  as  the  resistance  and \nthe  square  of  the  time  conjunctly)  are  nearly  the  same  in  both  curves :  for \nin  the  cycloid  those  differences  must  be  on  the  one  hand  augmented,  with \nthe  resistance,  in  about  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  arc  to  the  chord,  because \nof  the  velocity  augmented  in  the  simple  ratio  of  the  same ;  and  on  the \nother  hand  diminished,  with  the  square  of  the  time,  in  the  same  duplicate \nratio. Therefore  to  reduce  these  observations  to  the  cycloid,  we  must  take \nthe  same  differences  of  the  arcs  as  were  observed  in  the  circle,  and  suppose \nthe  greatest  velocities  analogous  to  the  half,  or  the  whole  arcs,  that  is,  to \nthe  numbers  \u00b1,  1,  2,  4,  8,  16.", "alogous  to  the  half,  or  the  whole  arcs,  that  is,  to \nthe  numbers  \u00b1,  1,  2,  4,  8,  16. Therefore  in  the  2d,  4th,  and  6th  cases,  put \n1,4,  and  1 6  for  V ;  and  the  difference  of  the  arcs  in  the  2d  case  will  become \ni  2 \n* =  A  +  B  +  C;  in  the4th  case,  ^-  =  4A  +  SB  +  160  ;  in  the  6th \n121  OOj \ncase,  ^  =  16A  +  64B  -f-  256C. These   equations   reduced   give  A  = \n9? 0,000091 \n6,  B  =-. 0,0010847,  \nand  \nC  =  0,0029558. Therefore  \nthe  \ndifference \nof  the  arcs  is  as  0,0000916V  -f  0,0010847V*  +  0,0029558 V* :  and  there \nfore  since  (by  Cor. Prop. XXX,  applied  to  this  case)  the  re.-ist;mcc  of  the \nglobe  in  the  middle  of  the  arc  described  in  oscillating,  where  the  velocity \nis  V,  is  to  its  weight  as  T7TAV  -f-  T\\BV^  +  f  CV2  to  the  length  of  the \npendulum,  if  for  A,  B,  and  C  you  put  the  numbers  found,  the  resistance  of \nthe  globe  will  be  to  its  weight  as  0,0000583V  +  0,0007593V*  +  0,OJ22169V2 \nto  the  length  of  the  pendulum  between  the  centre  of  suspension  and  the \nruler,  that  is,  to  121  inches.", "the  pendulum  between  the  centre  of  suspension  and  the \nruler,  that  is,  to  121  inches. Therefore  since  V  in  the  second  case  repre \nsents  1,  in  the  4th  case  4,  and  in  the  6th  case  16,  the  resistance  will  be  to \nthe  weight  of  the  globe,  in  the  2d  case,  as  0,0030345  to  121 ;  in  the  4th,  as \n0,041748  to  121 ;  in  the  6th,  as  0,61705  to  121.", "SEC. VI.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 315 \nThe  arc,  which  the  point  marked  in  the  thread  described  in  the  6th  case, \nwas  of  120  \u2014  Q^,  or  119/g  inches. And  therefore  since  the  radius  was \nya \n121  inches,  and  the  length  of  the  pendulum  between  the  point  of  suspen \nsion  and  the  centre  of  the  globe  was  126  inches,  the  arc  which  the  centre  of \nthe  globe  described  was  124/T  inches. Because  the  greatest  velocity  of  the \noscillating  body,  by  reason  of  the  resistance  of  the  air,  does  not  fall  on  the \nlowest  point  of  the  arc  described,  but  near  the  middle  place  of  the  whole \narc,  this  velocity  will  be  nearly  the  same  as  if  the  globe  in  its  whole  descent \nin  a  non-resisting  medium  should  describe  62 ^  inches,  the  half  of  that  arc, \nand  that  in  a  cycloid,  to  which  we  have  above  reduced  the  motion  of  the \npendulum;  and  therefore  that  velocity  will  be  equal  to  that  which  the \nglobe  would  acquire  by  falling  perpendicularly  from  a  height  equal  to  the \nversed  sine  of  that  arc. But  that  versed  sine  in  the  cycloid  is  to  that  arc \n62/2  as  the  same  arc  to  twice  the  length  of  the  pendulum  252,  and  there \nfore  equal  to  15,278  inches.", "arc  to  twice  the  length  of  the  pendulum  252,  and  there \nfore  equal  to  15,278  inches. Therefore  the  velocity  of  the  pendulum  is  the \nsame  which  a  body  would  acquire  by  falling,  and  in  its  fall  describing  a \nspace  of  15,278  inches. Therefore  with  such  a  velocity  the  globe  meets \nwith  a  resistance  which  is  to  its  weight  as  0,61705  to  121,  or  (if  we  take \nthat  part  only  of  the  resistance  which  is  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  ve- \nloc.ty)  as  0,56752  to  121. I  found,  by  an  hydrostatical  experiment,  that  the  weight  of  this  wooden \nglobe  was  to  the  weight  of  a  globe  of  water  of  the  same  magnitude  as  55 \nto  97:  and  therefore  since  121  is  to  213,4  in  the  same  ratio,  the  resistance \nmade  to  this  globe  of  water,  moving  forwards  with  the  above-mentioned \nvelocity,  will  be  to  its  weight  as  0,56752  to  213,4,  that  is,  as  1  to  376^.", "entioned \nvelocity,  will  be  to  its  weight  as  0,56752  to  213,4,  that  is,  as  1  to  376^. Whence  since  the  weight  of  a  globe  of  water,  in  the  time  in  which  the \nglobe  with  a  velocity  uniformly  continued  describes  a  length  of  30,556 \ninches,  will  generate  all  that  velocity  in  the  falling  globe,  it  is  manifest \nthat  the  force  of  resistance  uniformly  continued  in  the  same  time  will  take \naway  a  velocity,  which  will  be  less  than  the  other  in  the  ratio  of  1  to  376^-0, \nthat  is,  the  rr^-r  part  of  the  whole  velocity. And  therefore  in  the  time \n37  VSG \nJiat  the  globe,  with  the  same  velocity  uniformly  continued,  would  describe \nthe  length  of  its  semi-diameter,  or  3T\\  inches,  it  would  lose  the  3^42  part \nof  its  motion. I  also  counted  the  oscillations  in  which  the  pendulum  lost  j  part  of  its \nmotion. In  the  following  table  the  upper  numbers  denote  the  length  of  the \narc  described  in  the  first  descent,  expressed  in  inches  and  parts  of  an  inch ; \nthe  middle  numbers  denote  the  length  of  the  arc  described  in  the  last  as \ncent  ;  and  in  the  lowest  place  are  the  numbers  of  the  oscillations.

Therefore  the  resistances  of  these  equally  swift \nglobes  were  in  less  than  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  diameters. But  we  have \nnot  yet  considered  the  resistance  of  the  thread,  which  was  certainly  very \nconsiderable,  and  ought  to  be  subducted  from  the  resistance  of  the  pendu \nlums  here  found.

For  the  ratio  of  7}  \u2014  }  to  1  \u2014  \u00a3,  or  l(H  to  1  is  not  very \ndifferent  from  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  diameters  1  L}f  to  I. Since  the  resistance  of  the  thread  is  of  less  moment  in  greater  globes,  I \ntried  the  experiment  also  with  a  globe  whose  diameter  was  ISf  inches. The  length  of  the  pendulum  between  the  point  of  suspension  and  the  cen \ntre  of  oscillation  was  122|  inches,  and  between  the  point  of  suspension  and \nthe  knot  in  the  thread  109|  inches. The  arc  described  by  the  knot  at  the \nfirst  descent  of  the  pendulum  was  32  inches. The  arc  described  by  the \nsame  knot  in  the  last  ascent  after  five  oscillations  was  2S  inches. The \nsum  of  the  arcs,  or  the  whole  arc  described  in  one  mean  oscillation,  was  60 \ninches. The  difference  of  the  arcs  4  inches. The  y1,,-  part  of  this,  or  the \ndifference  between  the  descent  and  ascent  in  one  mean  oscillation,  is  f  of \nan  inch.", "e \ndifference  between  the  descent  and  ascent  in  one  mean  oscillation,  is  f  of \nan  inch. Then  as  the  radius  10(J|  to  the  radius  122^,  so  is  the  whole  arc \nof  60  inches  described  by  the  knot  in  one  mean  oscillation  to  the  whole  arc \nof  67}  inches  described  by  the  centre  of  the  globe  in  one  mean  oscillation ; \nand  so  is  the  difference  |  to  a  new  difference  0,4475. If  the  length  of  the \narc  described  were  to  remain,  and  the  length  of  the  pendulum  should  be \naugmented  in  the  ratio  of  126  to  122},  the  time  of  the  oscillation  would \nbe  augmented,  and  the  velocity  of  the  pendulum  would  be  diminished  in \nthe  subduplicate  of  that  ratio  ;  so  that  the  difference  0,4475  of  the  arcs  de \nscribed  in  the  descent  and  subsequent  ascent  would  remain. Then  if  the \narc  described  be  augmented  in  the  ratio  of  124  33T  to  67},  that  difference \n0.4475  would  be  augmented  in  the  duplicate  of  that  ratio,  and  so  would \nbecome  1,5295. These  things  would  be  so  upon  the  supposition  that  the \nresistance  of  the  pendulum  were  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.", "ition  that  the \nresistance  of  the  pendulum  were  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity. Therefore  if  the  pendulum  describe  the  whole  arc  of  12433T  inches,  and  its \nlength  between  the  point  of  suspension  and  the  centre  of  oscillation  be  126 \ninches,  the  difference  of  the  arcs  described  in  the  descent  and  subsequent \nascent  would  be  1,5295  inches. And  this  difference  multiplied  into  the \nweight  of  the  pendulous  globe,  which  was  208  ounces,  produces  318,136. Again ;  in  the  pendulum  above-mentioned,  made  of  a  wooden  globe,  when \nits  centre  of  oscillation,  being  126  inches  from  the  point  of  suspension,  de \nscribed  the  whole  arc  of  124 /T  inches,  the  difference  of  the  arcs  described \nin  the  descent  and  ascent  was  ^^   into  ^. This   multiplied    into    the \ni/wi         y^ \nweight  of  the  globe,  which  was  57-272  ounces,  produces  49,396. But  I  mul \ntiply  these  differences  into  the  weights  of  the  globes,  in  order  to  find  their \nresistances. For  the  differences  arise  from  the  resistances,  and  are  as  the \nresistances  directly  and  the  weights  inversely. Therefore  the  resistances \nare  as  the  numbers  318,136  and  49,396. But  that  part  of  the  resistance", "31 S  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    1L \nof  the  lesser  globe,  which  is  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity,  was  to \nthe  whole  resistance  as  0,56752  to-  0,61675,  that  is,  as  45,453  to  49,396 ; \nwhereas  that  part  of  the  resistance  of  the  greater  globe  is  almost  equal  to \nits  whole  resistance ;  and  so  those  parts  are  nearly  as  318,136  and  45,453, \nthat  is,  as  7  and  1. But  the  diameters  of  the  globes  are  18f  and  6| ;  and \ntheir  squares  351T9\u00a5  and  47 \u00a3J  are  as  7,438  and  1,  that  is,  as  the  resistances \nof  the  globes  7  and  1,  nearly. The  difference  of  these  ratios  is  scarce \ngreater  than  may  arise  from  the  resistance  of  the  thread. Therefore  those \nparts  of  the  resistances  which  are,  when  the  globes  are  equal,  as  the  squares \nof  the  velocities,  are  also,  when  the  velocities  are  equal,  as  the  squares  of \nthe  diameters  of  the  globes. But  the  greatest  of  the  globes  I  used  in  these  experiments  was  not  per \nfectly  spherical,  and  therefore  in  this  calculation  I  have,  for  brevity's  sake, \nneglected  some  little  niceties ;  being  not  very  solicitous  for  an  accurate \ncalculus  in  an  experiment  that  was  not  very  accurate.", "very  solicitous  for  an  accurate \ncalculus  in  an  experiment  that  was  not  very  accurate. So  that  I  could \nwish  that  these  experiments  were  tried  again  with  other  globes,  of  a  larger \nsize,  more  in  number,  and  more  accurately  formed ;  since  the  demonstra \ntion  of  a  vacuum  depends  thereon.

The  oscillations  in  the \nair  were  indeed  a  little  swifter  than  those  in  the  water. But  if  the  oscil \nlations  in  the  water  were  accelerated  in  such  a  ratio  that  the  motions  of \nthe  pendulums  might  be  equally  swift  in  both  mediums,  there  would  be \nstill  the  same  number  1  j  of  oscillations  in  the  water,  and  by  these  the \nsame  quantity  of  motion  would  be  lost  as  before  ;  because  the  resistance  i> \nincreased,  and  the  square  of  the  time  diminished  in  the  same  duplicate  ra \ntio.

If  the  whole  thread  of  the  pendulum  oscillating  in  the  water  had  been  im \nmersed,  its  resistance  would  have  been  still  greater  ;  so  that  the  resistance \nof  the  pendulum  oscillating  in  the  water,  that  is,  that  part  which  is  pro \nportional  to  the  square  of  the  velocity,  and  which  only  needs  to  be  consid \nered  in  swift  bodies,  is  to  the  resistance  of  the  same  whole  pendulum,  oscil \nlating  in  air  with  the  same  velocity,  as  about  850  to  1,  that  is  as,  the  den \nsity  of  water  to  the  density  of  air,  nearly.", "s  about  850  to  1,  that  is  as,  the  den \nsity  of  water  to  the  density  of  air,  nearly. In  this  calculation  we  ought  also  to  have  taken  in  that  part  of  the  re \nsistance  of  the  pendulum  in  the  water  which  was  as  the  square  of  the  ve \nlocity  ;  but  I  found  (which  will  perhaps  seem  strange)  that  the  resistance \nin  the  water  was  augmented  in  more  than  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity. In  searching  after  the  cause,  I  thought  upon  this,  that  the  vessel  was  toe", "320  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    II. narrow  for  the  magnitude  of  the  pendulous  globe,  and  by  its  narrowness \nobstructed  the  motion  of  the  water  as  it  yielded  to  the  oscillating  globe. For  when  I  immersed  a  pendulous  globe,  whose  diameter  was  one  inch  only, \nthe  resistance  was  augmented  nearly  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity, \nI  tried  this  by  making  a  pendulum  of  two  globes,  of  which  the  lesser  and \nlower  oscillated  in  the  water,  and  the  greater  and  higher  was  fastened  to \nthe  thread  just  above  the  water,  and,  by  oscillating  in  the  air,  assisted  the \nmotion  of  the  pendulum,  and  continued  it  longer. The  experiments  made \nby  this  contrivance  proved  according  to  the  following  table.

The  length  of  the  iron \nwire  was  about  3  feet,  and  the  diameter  of  the  pendulous  globe  about  i  of \nan  inch.", "wire  was  about  3  feet,  and  the  diameter  of  the  pendulous  globe  about  i  of \nan  inch. To  the  wire,  just  above  the  quicksilver,  there  was  fixed  another \nleaden  globe  of  a  bigness  sufficient  to  continue  the  motion  of  the  pendulum \nfor  some  time. Then  a  vessel,  that  would  hold  about  3  pounds  of  quick \nsilver,  was  filled  by  turns  with  quicksilver  and  common  water,  that,  by \nmaking  the  pendulum  oscillate  successively  in  these  two  different  fluids,  I \nmight  find  the  proportion  of  their  resistances ;  and  the  resistance  of  the \nquicksilver  proved  to  be  to  the  resistance  of  water  as  about  13  or  14  to  1  ; \nthat  is. as  the  density  of  quicksilver  to  the  density  of  water. When  I  made \nuse  of  a  pendulous  globe  something  bigger,  as  of  one  whose  diameter  was \nabout  ^  or  |  of  an  inch,  the  resistance  of  the  quicksilver  proved  to  be  to \nthe  resistance  of  the  water  as  about  12  or  10  to  1. But  the  former  experi \nment  is  more  to  be  relied  on,  because  in  the  latter  the  vessel  was  too  nar \nrow  in  proportion  to  the  magnitude  of  the  immersed  globe;  for  the  vessel \nought  to  have  been  enlarged  together  with  the  globe.", "he  immersed  globe;  for  the  vessel \nought  to  have  been  enlarged  together  with  the  globe. I  intended  to  have \nrepeated  these  experiments  with  larger  vessels,  and  in  melted  metals,  and \nother  liquors  both  cold  and  hot ;  but  I  had  not  leisure  to  try  all:  and  be \nsides,  from  what  is  already  described,  it  appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist \nance  of  bodies  moving  swiftly  is  nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of \nthe  fluids  in  which  they  move.

Lastly,  since  it  is  the  opinion  of  some  that  there  is  a  certain  ^ethereal \nmedium  extremely  rare  and  subtile,  which  freely  pervades  the  pores  of  all \nbodies ;  and  from  such  a  medium,  so  pervading  the  pores  of  bodies,  some  re \nsistance  must  needs  arise;  in  order  to  try  whether  the  resistance,  which  wre \nexperience  in  bodies  in  motion,  be  made  upon  their  outward  superficies  only, \nor  whether  their  internal  parts  meet  with  any  considerable  resistance  upon \ntheir  superficies,  I  thought  of  the  following  experiment  I  suspended  a \nround  deal  box  by  a  thread  11  feet  long,  on  a  steel  hook,  by  means  of  a  ring \nof  the  s-ime  metal,  so  as  to  make  a  pendulum  of  the  aforesaid  length. The \nhook  had  a  sharp  hollowr  edge  on  its  upper  part,  so  that  the  upper  arc  of \nthe  ring  pressing  on  the  edge  might  move  the  more  freely ;  and  the  thread \nwas  fastened  to  the  lower  arc  of  the  ring.", "ght  move  the  more  freely ;  and  the  thread \nwas  fastened  to  the  lower  arc  of  the  ring. The  pendulum  being  thus  pre \npared,  I  drew  it  aside  from  the  perpendicular  to  the  distance  of  about  6 \nfeet,  and  that  in  a  plane  perpendicular  to  the  edge  of  the  hook,  lest  the \nring,  while  the  pendulum  oscillated,  should  slide  to  and  fro  on  the  edge  of \nthe  hook :  for  the  point  of  suspension,  in  which  the  ring  touches  the  hook, \nought  to  remain  immovable. I  therefore  accurately  noted  the  place  to \nwhich  the  pendulum  was  brought,  and  letting  it  go,  I  marked  three  other \nplaces,  to  which  it  returned  at  the  end  of  the  1st,  2d,  and  3d  oscillation. This  I  often  repeated,  that  I  might  find  those  places  as  accurately  as  pos \nsible. Then  I  filled  the  box  with  lead  and  other  heavy  metals  that  were \nnear  at  hand. But,  first,  I  weighed  the  box  when  empty,  and  that  pnrt  of \nthe  thread  that  went  round  it,  and  half  the  remaining  part,  extended  be \ntween  the  hook  and  the  suspended  box ;  for  the  thread  so  extended  always \nacts  upon  the  pendulum,  when  drawn  aside  from  the  perpendicular,  with  half \nits  weight.", "acts  upon  the  pendulum,  when  drawn  aside  from  the  perpendicular,  with  half \nits  weight. To  this  weight  I  added  the  weight  of  the  air  contained  in  the \nbox  And  this  whole  weight  was  about  -fj  of  the  weight  of  the  box  when \nfilled  writh  the  metals. Then  because  the  box  when  full  of  the  metals,  by  ex \ntending  the  thread  with  its  weight,  increased  the  length  of  the  pendulum, \nf  shortened  the  thread  so  as  to  make  the  length  of  the  pendulum,  when  os \ncillating,  the  same  as  before. Then  drawing  aside  the  pendulum  to  the \nplace  first  marked,  and  letting  it  go,  I  reckoned  about  77  oscillations  before \nthe  box  returned  to  the  second  mark,  and  as  many  afterwards  before  it  came \nto  the  third  mark,  and  as  many  after  that  before  it  came  to  the  fourth \nxnark. From  whence  I  conclude  that  the  whole  resistance  of  the  box,  when \nfull,  had  not  a  greater  proportion  to  the  resistance  of  the  box,  when  empty, \nthan  78  to  77. For  if  their  resistances  were  equal,  the  box,  when  full,  by \nreason  of  its  vis  insita,  which  was  78  times  greater  than  the  vis  tfuritoof \nthe  same  when  empty,  ought  to  have  continued  its  oscillating  motion  so \n21", "322  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  |  \nBOOK    II. much  the  longer,  and  therefore  to  have  returned  to  those  marks  at  the  end \nof  78  oscillations. But  it  returned  to  them  at  the  end  of  77  oscillations. Let,  therefore,  A  represent  the  resistance  of  the  box  upon  its  external \nsuperficies,  and  B  the  resistance  of  the  empty  box  on  its  internal  superficies ; \nand  if  the  resistances  to  the  internal  parts  of  bodies  equally  swift  be  as  the \nmatter,  or  the  number  of  particles  that  are  resisted,  then  78B  will  be  the \nresistance  made  to  the  internal  parts  of  the  box,  when  full ;  and  therefore \nthe  whole  resistance  A  +  B  of  the  empty  box  will  be  to  the  whole  resist \nance  A  +  7SB  of  the  full  box  as  77  to  78,  and,  by  division,  A  +  B  to  77B \nas  77  to  1 ;  and  thence  A  +  B  to  B  as  77  X  77  to  1,  and,  by  division \nagain,  A  to  B  as  5928  to  1. Therefore  the  resistance  of  the  empty  box  in \nits  internal  parts  will  be  above  5000  times  less  than  the  resistance  on  its \nexternal  superficies. This  reasoning  depends  upon  the  supposition  that  the \ngreater  resistance  of  the  full  box  arises  not  from  any  other  latent  cause, \nbut  only  from  the  action  of  some  subtile  fluid  upon  the  included  metal.", "latent  cause, \nbut  only  from  the  action  of  some  subtile  fluid  upon  the  included  metal.

The  first  time  I  made  it,  the  hook  being  weak,  the  full  box  was  retarded \nsooner. The  cause  I  found  to  be,  that  the  hook  was  not  strong  enough  to \nbear  the  weight  of  the  box :  so  that,  as  it  oscillated  to  and  fro,  the  hook \nwas  bent  sometimes  this  and  sometimes  that  way.

To  define  the  motion  of  water  running  out  of  a  cylindrical  vessel  through \na  hole  made  at  the  bottom. Let  AC  D  B  be  a  cylindrical  vessel,  AB  the  mouth  p  =  Q: \nof  it,  CD  the  bottom  p  irallel  to  the  horizon,  EF  a \ncircular  hole  in  the  middle  of  the  bottom,  G  the \nc-?ritre  of  the  hole,  and  GH  the  axis  of  the  cylin-  Kj \ncler  perpendicular  to  the  horizon.", "tre  of  the  hole,  and  GH  the  axis  of  the  cylin-  Kj \ncler  perpendicular  to  the  horizon. And  suppose  a \ncylinder  of  ice  APQ,B  to  be  of  the  same  breadth \nwith  the  cavity  of  the  vessel,  and  to  have  the  same \naxis,  and  to  descend  perpetually  with  an  uniform \nmotion,  and  that  its  parts,  as  soon  as  they  touch  the \nsuperficies   AB,   dissolve    into    water,   and    flow \n(  wn  by  their  weight  into  the  vessel,  and  in  their \nfall   compose   the  cataract    or  column    of  water \nABNFEM,  passing  through  the  hole  EF,  and  filling  up  the  same  exactly. Let  the  uniform  velocity  of  the  descending  ice  and  of  the  contiguous  water \nin  the  circle  AB  be  that  which  the  water  would  acquire  by  falling  through \nthe  space  IH  ;  and  let  IH  and  HG  lie  in  the  same  right  line ;  and  through", "332  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    Jl \nthe  point  I  let  there  be  drawn  the  right  line  KL  parallel  to  the  horizon \nand  meeting  the  ice  on  both  the  sides  thereof  in  K  and  L. Then  the  ve \nlocity  of  the  water  running  out  at  the  hole  EF  will  be  the  same  that  it \nwould  acquire  by  falling  from  I  through  the  space  IG. Therefore,  by \nGalih'cJ's  Theorems,  IG  will  be  to  IH  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velo \ncity  of  the  water  that  runs  out  at  the  hole  to  the  velocity  of  the  wrater  in \nthe  circle  AB,  that  is,  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  circle  AB  to  the  circle \nEF ;  those  circles  being  reciprocally  as  the  velocities  of  the  water  which \nin  the  same  time  and  in  equal  quantities  passes  severally  through  each  of \nthem,  and  completely  fills  them  both. We  are  now  considering  the  velo \ncity  with  which  the  water  tends  to  the  plane  of  the  horizon. But  the  mo \ntion  parallel  to  the  same,  by  which  the  parts  of  the  falling  water  approach  to \neach  other,  is  not  here  taken  notice  of;  since  it  is  neither  produced  by \ngravity,  nor  at  all  changes  the  motion  perpendicular  to  the  horizon  which  the \ngravity  produces.", "nor  at  all  changes  the  motion  perpendicular  to  the  horizon  which  the \ngravity  produces. We  suppose,  indeed,  that  the  parts  of  the  water  cohere \na  little,  that  by  their  cohesion  they  may  in  falling  approach  to  each  othei \nwith  motions  parallel  to  the  horizon  in  order  to  form  one  single  cataract, \nand  to  prevent  their  being  divided  into  several :  but  the  motion  parallel  to \nthe  horizon  arising  from  this  cohesion  does  not  come  under  our  present \nconsideration. CASE  1. Conceive  now  the  w^hole  cavity  in  the  vessel,  wrhich  encompasses \nthe  falling  water  ABNFEM,  to  be  full  of  ice,  so  that  the  water  may  pass \nthrough  the  ice  as  through  a  funnel. Then  if  the  water  pass  very  near  to \nthe  ice  only,  without  touching  it;  or,  which  is  the  same  tiling,  if  by  rea \nson  of  the  perfect  smoothness  of  the  surface  of  the  ice,  the  water,  though \ntouching  it. glides  over  it  writh  the  utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  le-ast \nresistance;  the  water  will  run  through  the  hole  EF  with  the  same  velocity \nas  before,  and  the  whole  weight  of  the  column  of  water  ABNFEM  will  be \nall  taken  up  as  before  in  forcing  out  the  water,  and  the  bottom  of  the  vessel \nwill  sustain  the  weight  of  the  ice  encompassing  that  column.", "the  bottom  of  the  vessel \nwill  sustain  the  weight  of  the  ice  encompassing  that  column. Let  now  the  ice  in  the  vessel  dissolve  into  water ;  yet  will  the  efflux  of \nthe  water  remain,  as  to  its  velocity,  the  same  as  before. It  will  not  be \nless,  because  the  ice  now  dissolved  will  endeavour  to  descend ;  it  will  not \nbe  greater,  because  the  ice. now  become  water,  cannot  descend  without  hin \ndering  the  descent  of  other  water  equal  to  its  own  descent. The  same  force \nought  always  to  generate  the  same  velocity  in  the  effluent  water. But  the  hole  at  the  bottom  of  the  vessel,  by  reason  of  the  oblique  mo \ntions  of  the  particles  of  the  effluent  water,  must  be  a  little  greater  than  before, \nFor  now  the  particles  of  the  water  do  not  all  of  them  pass  through  the \nhole  perpendicularly,  but,  flowing  down  on  all  parts  from  the  sides  of  the \nvessel,  and  converging  towards  the  hole,  pass  through  it  with  oblique  mo \ntions  :  r,r,d  in  tending  downwards  meet  in  a  stream  whose  diameter  is  a  little \nsmaller  below  the  hole  than  at  the  hole  itself :  its  diameter  being  to  the", "SEC. V1L! OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 333 \ndiameter  of  the  hole  as  5  to  6,  or  as  5^  to  6|,  very  nearly,  if  I  took  the \nmeasures  of  those  diameters  right. I  procured  a  very  thin  flat  plate,  hav \ning  a  hole  pierced  in  the  middle,  the  diameter  of  the  circular  hole  being \nf  parts  of  an  inch. And  that  the  stream  of  running  waters  might  not  be \naccelerated  in  falling,  and  by  that  acceleration  become  narrower,  I  fixed \nthis  plate  not  to  the  bottom,  but  to  the  side  of  the  vessel,  so  us  to  make  the \nwater  go  out  in  the  direction  of  a  line  parallel  to  the  horizon. Then,  when \nthe  vessel  was  full  of  water,  I  opened  the  hole  to  let  it  run  out ;  and  the \ndiameter  of  the  stream,  measured  with  great  accuracy  at  the  distance  of \nabout  half  an  inch  from  the  hole,  was  f  J-  of  an  inch. Therefore  the  di \nameter  of  this  circular  hole  was  to  the  diameter  of  the  stream  very  nearly \nas  25  to  21.", "er  of  this  circular  hole  was  to  the  diameter  of  the  stream  very  nearly \nas  25  to  21. So  that  the  water  in  passing  through  the  hole  converges  on \nall  sides,  and,  after  it  has  run  out  of  the  vessel,  becomes  smaller  by  converg \ning  in  that  manner,  and  by  becoming  smaller  is  accelerated  till  it  comes  to \nthe  distance  of  half  an  inch  from  the  hole,  and  at  that  distance  flows  in  a \nsmaller  stream  and  with  greater  celerity  than  in  the  hole  itself,  and  this \nin  the  ratio  of  25  X  25  to  21  X  21,  or  17  to  12,  very  nearly ;  that  is,  in \nabout  the  subdaplicate  ratio  of  2  to  1. Now  it  is  certain  from  experiments, \nthat  the  quantity  of  water  running  out  in  a  given  time  through  a  circular \nhole  made  in  the  bottom  of  a  vessel  is  equal  to  the  quantity,  which,  flow \ning  with  the  aforesaid  velocity,  would  run  out  in  the  same  time  through \nanother  circular  hole,  whose  diameter  is  to  the  diameter  of  the  former  as \n21  to  25. And  therefore  that  running  water  in  passing  through  the \nhole  itself  has  a  velocity  downwards  equal  to  that  which  a  heavy  body \nwould  acquire  in  falling  through  half  the  height  of  the  stagnant  water  in \nthe  vessel,  nearly.", "cquire  in  falling  through  half  the  height  of  the  stagnant  water  in \nthe  vessel,  nearly. But,  then,  after  it  has  run  out,  it  is  still  accelerated  by \nconverging,  till  it  arrives  at  a  distance  from  the  hole  that  is  nearly  equal  to \nits  diameter,  and  acquires  a  velocity  greater  than  the  other  in  about  the \nsubduplicate  ratio  of  2  to  1 ;  which  velocity  a  heavy  body  would  nearly \nacquire  by  falling  through  the  whole  height  of  the  stagnant  water  in  the \nvessel. Therefore  in  what  follows  let  the  diameter  of \nthe  stream  be  represented  by  that  lesser  hole  which \nwe  called  EF. And  imagine  another  plane  VW \nabove  the  hole  EF,  and  parallel  to  the  plane  there \nof,  to  be  placed  at  a  distance  equal  to  the  diame \nter  of  the  same  hole,  and  to  be  pierced  through \nwith  a  greater  hole  ST,  of  such  a  magnitude  that \na  stream  which  will  exactly  fill  the  lower  hole  EF \nmay  pass  through  it ;  the  diameter  of  which  hole \nwill  therefore  be  to  the  diameter  of  the  lower  hole  as  25  to  21,  nearly. By \nthis  means  the  water  will  run  perpendicularly  out  at  the  lower  hole ;  and \nthe  quantity  of  the  water  running  out  will  be,  according  to  the  magnitude", "334  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    11 \nof  this  last  hole,  the  same,  very  nearly,  which  the  solution  of  the  Problem \nrequires. The  space  included  between  the  two  planes  and  the  falling  stream \nmay  be  considered  as  the  bottom  of  the  vessel. But,  to  make  the  solution \nmore  simple  and  mathematical,  it  is  better  to  take  the  lower  plane  alone \nfor  the  bottom  of  the  vessel,  and  to  suppose  that  the  water  which  flowed \nthrough  the  ice  as  through  a  funnel,  and  ran  out  of  the  vessel  through  the \nhole  EF  made  in  the  lower  plane,  preserves  its  motion  continually,  and  that \nthe  ice  continues  at  rest. Therefore  in  what  follows  let  ST  be  the  diame \nter  of  a  circular  hole  described  from  the  centre  Z,  and  let  the  stream  run \nout  of  the  vessel  through  that  hole,  when  the  water  in  the  vessel  is  all \nfluid. And  let  EP  be  the  diameter  of  the  hole,  which  the  stream,  in  fall \ning  through,  exactly  fills  up,  whether  the  water  runs  out  of  the  vessel  by \nthat  upper  hole  ST,  or  flows  through  the  middle  of  the  ice  in  the  vessel, \nas  through  a  funnel.", "hole  ST,  or  flows  through  the  middle  of  the  ice  in  the  vessel, \nas  through  a  funnel. And  let  the  diameter  of  the  upper  hole  ST  be  to  the \ndiameter  of  the  lower  EF  as  about  25  to  21,  and  let  the  perpendicular  di& \ntance  between  the  planes  of  the  holes  be  equal  to  the  diameter  of  the  lesser \nhole  EF. Then  the  velocity  of  the  water  downwards,  in  running  out  of \nthe  vessel  through  the  hole  ST,  will  be  in  that  hole  the  same  that  a  body \nmay  acquire  by  falling  from  half  the  height  IZ ;  and  the  velocity  of  both \nthe  falling  streams  will  be  in  the  hole  EF,  the  same  which  a  body  would \nacquire  by  falling  from  the  Avhole  height  IG. CASE  2. If  the  hole  EF  be  not  in  the  middle  of  the  bottom  of  the  ves \nsel,  but  in  some  other  part  thereof,  the  water  will  still  run  out  with  the \nsame  velocity  as  before,  if  the  magnitude  of  the  hole  be  the  same. For \nthough  an  heavy  body  takes  a  longer  time  in  descending  to  the  same  depth, \nby  an  oblique  line,  than  by  a  perpendicular  line,  yet  in  both  cases  it  acquires \nin  its  descent  the  same  velocity ;  as  Galileo  has  demonstrated. CASE  3. The  velocity  of  the  water  is  the  same  when  it  runs  out  through \na  hole  in  the  side  of  the  vessel.", "f  the  water  is  the  same  when  it  runs  out  through \na  hole  in  the  side  of  the  vessel. For  if  the  hole  be  small,  so  that  the  in \nterval  between  the  superficies  AB  and  KL  may  vanish  ns  to  sense,  and  the \nstream  of  water  horizontally  issuing  out  may  form  a  parabolic  figure;  from \nthe  latus  rectum  of  this  parabola  may  be  collected,  that  the  velocity  of  the \neffluent  water  is  that  which  a  body  may  acquire  by  falling  the  height  IG \nor  HG  of  the  stagnant  water  in  the  vessel. For,  by  making  an  experi \nment,  I  found  that  if  the  height  of  the  stagnant  water  above  the  hole  were \n20  inches,  and  the  height  of  the  hole  above  a  plane  parallel  to  the  horizon \nwere  also  20  inches,  a  stream  of  water  springing  out  from  thence  wrould \nfall  upon  the  plane,  at  the  distance  of  37  inches,  very  nearly,  from  a  per \npendicular  let  fall  upon  that  plane  from  the  hole. For  without  resistance \nthe  stream  would  have  fallen  upon  the  plane  at  the  distance  of  40  inches, \nthe  latus  rectum  of  the  parabolic  stream  being  80  inches. CASE  4. If  the  effluent  water  tend  upward,  it  will  still  issue  forth  with \nthe  same  velocity. For  the  small  stream  of  water  springing  upward,  as-", "SEC.

And \nwhen  the  resistance  of  bodies  in  non-elastic  fluids  is  once  known,  we  may \nthen  augment  this  resistance  a  little  in  elastic  fluids,  as  our  air;  and  in \nthe  surfaces  of  stagnating  fluids,  as  lakes  and  seas.

For  the  globe  is  to  its  circumscribed  cylinder  as  two  to  three ;  and  there \nfore  the  force  which  can  destroy  all  the  motion  of  the  cylinder,  while  the \nsame  cylinder  is  describing  the  length  of  four  of  its  diameters,  will  destroy \nall  the  motion  of  the  globe,  while  the  globe  is  describing  two  thirds  of  this \nlength,  that  is,  eight  third  parts  of  its  own  diameter.

In  the  last  two  Propositions  we  suppose  (as  was  done  before  in  Lem. V) \nthat  all  the  water  which  precedes  the  globe,  and  whose  fluidity  increases \nthe  resistance  of  the  same,  is  congealed.

Be \nfore  they  were  let  fall,  they  were  totally  immersed  under  water,  lest,  by  the \nweight  of  any  part  of  them  that  might  chance  to  be  above  the  water,  their \ndescent  should  be  accelerated  in  its  beginning.

In  searching  for  the  cause  that  occasioned  these  globes  of  the  same  weight \nand  magnitude  to  fall,  some  swifter  and  some  slower,  I  hit  upon  this ;  that \nthe  globes,  when  they  were  first  let  go  and  began  to  fall,  oscillated  about \ntheir  centres;  that  side  which  chanced  to  be  the  heavier  descending  first, \nand  producing  an  oscillating  motion.", "which  chanced  to  be  the  heavier  descending  first, \nand  producing  an  oscillating  motion. Now  by  oscillating  thus,  the  globe \ncommunicates  a  greater  motion  to  the  water  than  if  it  descended  without \nany  oscillations ;  and  by  this  communication  loses  part  of  its  own  motion \nwith  which  it  should  descend ;  and  therefore  as  this  oscillation  is  greater \nor  less,  it  will  be  more  or  less  retarded. Besides,  the  globe  always  recedes \nfrom  that  side  of  itself  which  is  descending  in  the  oscillation,  and  by  so \nreceding  comes  nearer  to  the  sides  of  the  vessel,  so  as  even  to  strike  against \nthem  sometimes. And  the  heavier  the  globes  are,  the  stronger  this  oscil \nlation  is ;  and  the  greater  they  are,  the  more  is  the  water  agitated  by  it. Therefore  to  diminish  this  oscillation  of  the  globes,  1  made  new  ones  of \nlead  and  wax,  sticking  the  lead  in  one  side  of  the  globe  very  near  its  sur \nface;  and  I. let  fall  the  globe  in  such  a  manner,  that,  as  near  as  possible, \nthe  heavier  side  might  be  lowest  at  the  beginning  of  the  descent.

For  the  globes  in  falling  oscillate  a  little :  and  this  oscillation,  in  those \nglobes  that  are  light  and  fall  slowly,  soon  ceases  by  the  weakness  of  the \nmotion  ;  but  in  greater  and  heavier  globes,  the  motion  being  strong,  it  con \ntinues  longer,  and  is  not  to  be  checked  by  the  ambient  water  till  after  sev \neral  oscillations  Besides,  the  more  swiftly  the  globes  move,  the  less  are \nthey  pressed  by  the  fluid  at  their  hinder  parts;  and  if  the  velocity  be. per \npetually  increased,  they  will  at  last  leave  an  empty  space  behind  them, \nunless  the  compression  of  the  fluid  be  increased  at  the  same  time.

Anno  1719,  in  the  month  of  July,  Dr. Desaguliers  made \nsome  experiments  of  this  kind  again,  by  forming  hogs' bladders  into  spheri \ncal  orbs ;  which  was  done  by  means  of  a  concave  wooden  sphere,  which  the \nbladders,  being  wetted  well  first,  were  put  into.

And  in  the  mean \ntime  some  persons  standing  in  the  upper  part  of  the  church  where  the \nglobes  were  let  fall  observed  the  whole  times  of  falling  ;  and  others  stand \ning  on  the  ground  observed  the  differences  of  the  times  between  the  fall \nof  the  leaden  weight  and  the  fall  of  the  bladder. The  times  were  measured \nby  pendulums  oscillating  to  half  seconds. And  one  of  those  that  stood \nupon  the  ground  had  a  machine  vibrating  four  times  in  one  second  ;  and \nanother  had  another  machine  accurately  made  with  a  pendulum  vibrating \nfour  times  in  a  second  also. One  of  those  also  who  stood  at  the  top  of  the \nchurch  had  a  like  machine ;  and  these  instruments  were  so  contrived,  that \ntheir  motions  could  be  stopped  or  renewed  at  pleasure.", "truments  were  so  contrived,  that \ntheir  motions  could  be  stopped  or  renewed  at  pleasure.

In  the  Scholium  subjoined  to  the  sixth  Section,  we  shewed,  by  experi \nments  of  pendulums,  that  the  resistances  of  equal  and  equally  swift  globes \nmoving  in  air,  water,  and  quicksilver,  are  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. We  here  prove  the  same  more  accurately  by  experiments  of  bodies  falling \nin  air  and  water.", "here  prove  the  same  more  accurately  by  experiments  of  bodies  falling \nin  air  and  water. For  pendulums  at  each  oscillation  excite  a  motion  in \nthe  fluid  always  contrary  to  the  motion  of  the  pendulum  in  its  return  :  and \nthe  resistance  arising  from  this  motion,  as  also  the  resistance  of  the  thread \nby  which  the  pendulum  is  suspended,  makes  the  whole  resistance  of  a  pen \ndulum  greater  than  the  resistance  deduced  from  the  experiments  of  falling \nbodies. For  by  the  experiments  of  pendulums  described  in  that  Scholium, \na  globe  of  the  same  density  as  water  in  describing  the  length  of  its  semi- \ndiameter  in  air  would  lose  the  -3^-0  part  of  its  motion. But  by  the \ntheory  delivered  in  this  seventh  Section,  and  confirmed  by  experiments  of \nfalling  bodies,  the  same  globe  in  describing  the  same  length  would  lose  only \na  part  of  its  motion  equal  to  j-Vir? supposing  the  density  of  water  to  be \nto  the  density  of  air  as  8r>0  to  1. Therefore  the  resistances  were  found \ngreater  by  the  experiments  of  pendulums  (for  the  reasons  just  mentioned) \nthan  by  the  experiments  of  falling  globes  ;  and  that  in  the  ratio  of  about \n4  to  3.", "than  by  the  experiments  of  falling  globes  ;  and  that  in  the  ratio  of  about \n4  to  3. Bat  yet  since  the  resistances  of  pendulums  oscillating  in  air,  wa \nter,  and  quicksilver,  are  alike  increased  by  like  causes,  the  proportion  of \nthe  resistances  in  these  mediums  will  be  rightly  enough  exhibited  by  th\u00ab", "SEC. VII.J  OF    NATUKAL    PHILOSOPHY. 355 \nexperiments  of  pendulums,  as  well  as  by  the  experiments  of  falling  bodies. And  from  all  this  it  may  be  concluded,  that  the  resistances  of  bodies,  moving \nin  any  fluids  whatsoever,  though  of  the  most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris \nparibus,  as  the  densities  of  the  fluids. These  things  being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part \nof  its  motion  any  globe  projected  in  any  fluid  whatsoever  would  nearly  lose \nin  a  given  time. Let  D  be  the  diameter  of  the  globe,  and  V  its  velocity \nat  the  beginning  of  its  motion,  and  T  the  time  in  which  a  globe  with  the \nvelocity  V  can  describe  in  vacua  a  space  that  is,  to  the  space  |D  as  the \ndensity  of  the  globe  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  ;  and  the  globe  projected \n*V \nin  that  fluid  will,  in   any  other   time  t  lose  the  part  \u2122   ,  the   part \n1     -p    t \nTV \nr\u00bb  remaining ;  and  will  describe  a  space,  which  will  be  to  that  de \nscribed  in  the  same  time  in,  vacua  with   the  uniform   velocity  V,  as  the \nT  +  t \nlogarithm  of  the  number  \u2014 ~ \u2014  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is \nto  the  number  7^,  by  Cor. 7,  Prop. XXXV.", "\u2014 ~ \u2014  multiplied  by  the  number  2,302585093  is \nto  the  number  7^,  by  Cor. 7,  Prop. XXXV. In  slow  motions  the  resist \nance  may  be  a  little  less,  because  the  figure  of  a  globe  is  more  adapted  to \nmotion  than  the  figure  of  a  cylinder  described  with  the  same  diameter. In \nswift  motions  the  resistance  may  be  a  little  greater,  because  the  elasticity \nand  compression  of  the  fluid  do  not  increase  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the \nvelocity. But  these  little  niceties  I  take  no  notice  of. And  though  air. water,  quicksilver,  and  the  like  fluids,  by  the  division \nof  their  parts  in  infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and  become  mediums  in \nfinitely  fluid,  nevertheless,  the  resistance  they  would  make  to  projected \nglobes  would  be  the  same. For  the  resistance  considered  in  the  preceding \nPropositions  arises  from  the  inactivity  of  the  matter;  and  the  inactivity \nof  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity \nof  matter.", "y \nof  matter  is  essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity \nof  matter. By  the  division  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  the  resistance  arising \nfrom  the  tenacity  and  friction  of  the  parts  may  be  indeed  diminished :  but \nthe  quantity  of  matter  will  not  be  at  all  diminished  by  this  division ;  and \nif  the  quantity  of  matter  be  the  same,  its  force  of  inactivity  will  be  the \nsame ;  and  therefore  the  resistance  here  spoken  of  will  be  the  sanue,  as  being \nalways  proportional  to  that  force. To  diminish  this  resistance,  the  quan \ntity  of  matter  in  the  spaces  through  which  the  bodies  move  must  be  dimin \nished  ;  and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces,  through  which  the  globes  of  the \nplanets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts,  with  the \nutmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of  their  motion, \nmust  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid,  excepting,  perhaps,  some  ex \ntremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of  light.", "356  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    11.

Now  this  excess  of \npressure  does,  in  proportion  to  its  quantity,  not  only  excite  a  motion  in  the \nfluid,  but  also  acts  upon  the  projectile  so  as  to  retard  its  motion  ;  and  there \nfore  the  resistance  in  every  fluid  is  as  the  motion  excited  by  the  projectile \nin  the  fluid ;  and  cannot  be  less  in  the  most  subtile  aether  in  proportion  to \nthe  density  of  that  aether,  than  it  is  in  air,  water,  and  Quicksilver,  in  pro \nportion  to  the  densities  of  those  fluids.

Then  since  the  cause  of  this  propagation  is \nthat  the  parts  of  the  medium  that  are  near  the  centre  A  disturb  and  agitate \nthose  which  lie  farther  from  it;  and  since  the  parts  which  are  urged  are \nfluid,  and  therefore  recede  every  way  towards  those  spaces  where  they  are \nless  pressed,  they  will  by  consequence  recede  towards  all  the  parts  of  tht \nquiescent  medium;  as  well  to  the  parts  on  each  hand,  as  KL  and  NO, \nas  to  those  right  before,  as  PQ, ;  and  by  this  means  all  the  motion,  as  soon \nas  it  has  passed  through  the  hole  BC,  will  begin  to  dilate  itself,  and  from \nthence,  as  from  its  principle  and  centre,  will  be  propagated  directly  every \nway.

Every  tremulous  body  in  an  elastic  medium  propagates  the  motion  of \nthe  pulses  on  every  side  right  forward  ;  but  in  a  non-elastic  medium \nexcites  a  circular  motion. CASE. 1.", "ry  side  right  forward  ;  but  in  a  non-elastic  medium \nexcites  a  circular  motion. CASE. 1. The  parts  of  the  tremulous  body,  alternately  going  and  return \ning,  do  in  going  urge  and  drive  before  them  those  parts  of  the  medium  that \nlie  nearest,  and  by  that  impulse  compress  and  condense  Nthem  ;  and  in  re \nturning  suffer  those  compressed  parts  to  recede  again,  and  expand  them \nselves. Therefore  the  parts  of  the  medium  that  lie  nearest  to  the  tremulous \nbody  move  to  and  fro  by  turns,  in  like  manner  as  the  parts  of  the  tremulous \nbody  itself  do ;  and  for  the  same  cause  that  the  parts  of  this  body  agitate \nthese  parts  of  the  medium,  these  parts,  being  agitated  by  like  tremors,  will \nin  their  turn  agitate  others  next  to  themselves ;  and  these  others,  agitated \nin  like  manner,  will  agitate  those  that  lie  beyond  them,  and  so  on  in,  infin- \nitum. And  in  the  same  manner  as  the  lirst  parts  of  the  medium  were \ncondensed  in  going,  and  relaxed  in  returning,  so  will  the  other  parts  be \ncondensed  every  time  they  go,  and  expand  themselves  every  time  they  re \nturn.", "parts  be \ncondensed  every  time  they  go,  and  expand  themselves  every  time  they  re \nturn. And  therefore  they  will  not  be  all  going  and  all  returning  at  the \nsame  instant  (for  in  that  case  they  would  always  preserve  determined  dis \ntances  from  each  other,  and  there  could  be  no  alternate  condensation  and \nrarefaction) ;  but  since,  in  the  places  where  they  are  condensed,  they  ap \nproach  to,  and,  in  the  places  where  they  are  rarefied,  recede  from  each  other, \ntherefore  some  of  them  will  be  going  while  others  are  returning ;  and  so  on \nin  infinitum. The  parts  so  going,  and  in  their  going  condensed,  are  pulses, \nby  reason  of  the  progressive  motion  with  which  they  strike  obstacles  in \ntheir  way;  and  therefore  the  successive  pulses  produced  by  a  tremulous \nbody  will  be  propagated  in  rectilinear  directions ;  and  that  at  nearly  equal \ndistances  from  each  other,  because  of  the  equal  intervals  of  time  in  which \nthe  body,  by  its  several  tremors  produces  the  several  pulses. And  though \nthe  parts  of  the  tremulous  body  go  and  return  .n  some  certain  and  deter \nminate  direction,  yet  the  pulses  propagated  from  thence  through  the  medium \nwill  dilate  themselves  towards  the  sides,  by  the  foregoing  Proposition :  anc7", "360  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BoOK    11 \nwill  be  propagated  on  all  sides  from  that  tremulous  body,  as  from  a  com \nmon  centre,  in  superficies  nearly  spherical  and  concentrical.

For  the  gravity  of  the  water \nsupplies  the  place  of  elastic  force. Case  2. If  the  medium  be  not  elastic,  then,  because  its  parts  cannot  be \ncondensed  by  the  pressure  arising  from  the  vibrating  parts  of  the  tremulous \nbody,  the  motion  will  be  propagated  in  an  instant  towards  the  parts  where \nthe  medium  yields  most  easily,  that  is;  to  the  parts  which  the  tremulous \nbody  would  otherwise  leave  vacuous  behind  it. The  case  is  the  same  with \nthat  of  a  body  projected  in  any  medium  whatever. A  medium  yielding \nto  projectiles  does  not  recede  in  infinitum,  but  with  a  circular  motion  comes \nround  to  the  spaces  which  the  body  leaves  behind  it.", "but  with  a  circular  motion  comes \nround  to  the  spaces  which  the  body  leaves  behind  it.

And  though  the  tremulous \nbod}  be  not  firm  and  hard,  but  every  way  flexible,  yet  if  it  continue  of  a \ngiven  magnitude,  since  it  cannot  impel  the  medium  by  its  treniors  any \nwhere  without  yielding  to  it  somewhere  else,  the  medium  receding  from  the \nparts  of  the  body  where  it  is  pressed  will  always  come  round  in  a  circle  to \nthe  parts  that  yield  to  it.

Let  a  pendulum  be  constructed,  whose  length  between  the  point  of  sus \npension  and  the  centre  of  oscillation  is  equal  to  the  breadth  of  the  waves", "362  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  (BOOK    1L \nand  in  the  time  that  the  pendulum  will  perform  one  single  oscillation  the \nwaves  will  advance  forward  nearly  a  space  equal  to  their  breadth. That  which  I  call  the  breadth  of  the  waves  is  the  transverse  measure \nlying  between  the  deepest \n\u2014  part  of  the  hollows,  or  the \ntops  of  the  ridges. Let \nABCDEF  represent  the  surface  of  stagnant  water  ascending  and  descend \ning  in  successive  waves ;  and  let  A,  C,  E,  &c.,  be  the  tops  of  the  waves ; \nand  let  B,  D,  F,  &c.,  be  the  intermediate  hollows. Because  the  motion  of \nthe  waves  is  carried  on  by  the  successive  ascent  and  descent  of  the  water, \nso  that  the  parts  thereof,  as  A,  C,  E,  &c.,  which  are  highest  at  one  time \nbecome  lowest  immediately  after ;  and  because  the  motive  force,  by  which \nthe  highest  parts  descend  and  the  lowest  ascend,  is  the  weight  of  the  eleva \nted  water,  that  alternate  ascent  and  descent  will  be  analogous  to  the  recip \nrocal  motion  of  the  water  in  the  canal,  and  observe  the  same  laws  as  to  the \ntimes  of  its  ascent  and  descent;  and  therefore  (by  Prop.", "rve  the  same  laws  as  to  the \ntimes  of  its  ascent  and  descent;  and  therefore  (by  Prop.

Therefore  between  the  pas \nsage  of  each  wave,  the  time  of  two  oscillations  will  intervene ;  that  is,  the \nwave  will  describe  its  breadth  in  the  time  that  pendulum  will  oscillate \ntwice;  but  a  pendulum  of  four  times  that  length,  and  which  therefore  is \nequal  to  the  breadth  of  the  waves,  will  just  oscillate  once  in  that  time.

Therefore  equal  and \ncorresponding  parts  of  corresponding  pulses  will  go  and  return  together, \nthrough  spaces  proportional  to  their  contractions  and  dilatations,  with  ve \nlocities  that  are  as  those  spaces ;  and  therefore  the  pulses,  which  in  the \ntime  of  one  going  and  returning  advance  forward  a  space  dq'aal  to  their \nbreadth,  and  are  always  succeeding  into  the  places  of  the  pulses  that  im \nmediately  go  before  them,  will,  by  reason  of  the  equality  of  the  distances, \ngo  forward  in  both  mediums  with  equal  velocity.

Suppose  a  pendulum  to  be  constructed  whose  length  between  the \npoint  of  suspension  and  the  centre  of  oscillation  is  A :  and  in  the  time  in \nwhich  that  pendulum  will  perform  one  entire  oscillation  composed  of \nits  going  and  returning,  the  pulse  will  be  propagated  right  onwards \nthrough  a  space  equal  to  the  circumference  of  a  circle  described  with  the \nradius  A. For,  letting  those  things  stand  which  were  constructed  in  Prop.

Therefore  since  the  times  of  the  oscillations  are  in  the \nsubduplicate  ratio  of  the  lengths  of  the  pendulums,  and  the  length  of  the \npendulum  is  equal  to  half  the  arc  of  the  whole  cycloid,  the  time  of  one  vi \nbration  would  be  to  the  time  of  the  oscillation  of  a  pendulum  whose  length \nis  A  in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of  the  length  ^PS  or  PO  to  the  length  A. But  the  elastic  force  with  which  the  physical  lineola  EG  is  urged,  when  it \nIs  found  in  its  extreme  places  P,  S,  was  (in  the  demonstration  of  Prop.

Therefore  since  the  times  in  which  equal  bodies  are  impelled \nthrough  equal  spaces  are  reciprocally  in  the  subduplicate \nratio  of  the  forces,  the  time  of  one  vibration,  produced  by \nthe  action  of  that  elastic  force,  will  be  to  the  time  of  a  vi \nbration,  produced  by. the  impulse  of  the  weight  in  a  subdu \nplicate  ratio  of  VV  to  PO  X  A,  and  therefore  to  the  time \nof  the  oscillation  of  a  pendulum  whose  length  is  A  in  the \nsubduplicate  ratio  of  VV  to  PO  X  A,  and  the  subdupli \ncate  ratio  of  PO  to  A  conjunctly ;  that  is,  in  the  entire  ra \ntio  of  V  to  A. But  in  the  time  of  one \nvibration  composed  of  the  going  and  re \nturning  of  the  pendulum,  the  pulse  will \nbe  propagated  right  onward  through  a \nspace  equal  to  its  breadth  BC. There \nfore  the  time  in  which  a  pulse  runs  over \nthe  space  BC  is  to  the  time  of  one  oscillation  composed  of \nthe  going  and  returning  of  the  pendulum  as  V  to  A,  that  is, \nas  BC  to  the  circumference  of  a  circle  whose  radius  is  A.", "ulum  as  V  to  A,  that  is, \nas  BC  to  the  circumference  of  a  circle  whose  radius  is  A. But  the  time  in  which  the  pulse  will  run  over  the  space  BC \nis  to  the  time  in  which  it  will  run  over  a  length  equal  to \nthat  circumference  in  the  same  ratio;  and  therefore  in  the \ntime  of  such  an  oscillation  the  pulse  will  run  over  a  length \nequal  to  that  circumference.

The  last  Propositions  respect  the  motions  of  light  and  sounds ;  for  since \nlight  is  propagated  in  right  lines,  it  is  certain  that  it  cannot  consist  in  ac \ntion  alone  (by  Prop. XLI  and  XLIl). As  to  sounds,  since  they  arise  from \ntremulous  bodies,  they  can  be  nothing  else  but  pulses  of  the  air  propagated \nthrough  it  (by  Prop. XLIII) ;  and  this  is  confirmed  by  the  tremors  which \nsounds,  if  they  be  loud  and  deep,  excite  in  the  bodies  near  them,  as  we  ex \nperience  in  the  sound  of  drums  ;  for  quick  and  short  tremors  are  less  easily \nexcited. But  it  is  well  known  that  any  sounds,  falling  upon  strings  in \nunison  with  the  sonorous  bodies,  excite  tremors  in  those  strings.", "lling  upon  strings  in \nunison  with  the  sonorous  bodies,  excite  tremors  in  those  strings. This  is \nalso  confirmed  from  the  velocity  of  sounds;  for  since  the  specific  gravities \nof  rain-water  and  quicksilver  are  to  one  another  as  about  1  to  13f,  and \nwhen  the  mercury  in  the  barometer  is  at  the  height  of  30  inches  of  our \nmeasure,  the  specific  gravities  of  the  air  and  of  rain-water  are  to  one \nanother  as  about  1  to  870,  therefore  the  specific  gravity  of  air  and  quick \nsilver  are  to  each  other  as  1  to  11890. Therefore  when  the  height  of \nthe  quicksilver  is  at  30  inches,  a  height  of  uniform  air,  whose  weight  would \nbe  sufficient  to  compress  our  air  to  the  density  we  find  it  to  be  of,  must  be \nequal  to  356700  inches,  or  29725  feet  of  our  measure ;  and  this  is  that \nvery  height  of  the  medium,  which  I  have  called  A  in  the  construction  of \nthe  foregoing  Proposition. A  circle  whose  radius  is  29725  feet  is  186768 \nfeet  in  circumference.", "egoing  Proposition. A  circle  whose  radius  is  29725  feet  is  186768 \nfeet  in  circumference. And  since  a  pendulum  39}  inches  in  length  com \npletes  one  oscillation,  composed  of  its  going  and  return,  in  two  seconds  of \ntime,  as  is  commonly  known,  it  follows  that  a  pendulum  29725  feet,  or \n356700  inches  in  length  will  perform  a  like  oscillation  in  190f  seconds. Therefore  in  that  time  a  sound  will  go  right  onwards  186768  feet,  and \ntherefore  in  one  second  979  feet. But  in  this  computation  we  have  made  no  allowance  for  the  crassitude \nof  the  solid  particles  of  the  air,  by  which  the  sound  is  propagated  instan \ntaneously. Because  the  weight  of  air  is  to  the  weight  of  water  as  1  tc \n870,  and  because  salts  are  almost  twice  as  dense  as  water ;  if  the  particles \nof  air  are  supposed  to  be  of  near  the  same  density  as  those  of  water  or  salt, \nand  the  rarity  of  the  air  arises  from  the  intervals  of  the  particles ;  the \ndiameter  of  one  particle  of  air  will  be  to  the  interval  between  the  centres", "SEC. VIIL]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 369 \nof  the  particles  as  1  to  about  9  or  10,  and  to  the  interval  between  the  par \nticles  themselves  as  1  to  8  or  9. Therefore  to  979  feet,  which,  according  to \nthe  above  calculation,  a  sound  will  advance  forward  in  one  second  of  time, \n\\ve  may  add  ^-\u00a39-,  or  about  109  feet,  io  compensate  for  the  cra-ssitude  of  the \nparticles  of  the  air :  and  then  a  sound  will  go  forward  about  1088  feet  in \none  second  of  time. Moreover,  the  vapours  floating  in  the  air  being  of  another  spring,  and  a \ndifferent  tone,  will  hardly,  if  at  all,  partake  of  the  motion  of  the  true  air \nin  which  the  sounds  are  propagated. Now  if  these  vapours  remain  unmov \ned,  that  motion  will  be  propagated  the  swifter  through  the  true  air  alone, \nand  that  in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of  the  defect  of  the  matter. So  if  the \natmosphere  consist  of  ten  parts  of  true  air  and  one  part  of  vapours,  the \nmotion  of  sounds  will  be  swifter  in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of  11  to  10,  or \nvery  nearly  in  the  entire  ratio  of  21  to  20,  than  if  it  were  propagated \nthrough  eleven  parts  of  true  air  :  and  therefore  the  motion  of  sounds  above \ndiscovered  must  be  increased  in  that  ratio.", ":  and  therefore  the  motion  of  sounds  above \ndiscovered  must  be  increased  in  that  ratio. By  this  means  the  sound  will \npass  through  1 142  feet  in  one  second  of  time. These  things  will  be  found  true  in  spring  and  autumn,  when  the  air  is \nrarefied  by  the  gentle  warmth  of  those  seasons,  and  by  that  means  its  elas \ntic  force  becomes  somewhat  more  intense. But  in  winter,  when  the  air  is \ncondensed  by  the  cold,  and  its  elastic  force  is  somewhat  remitted,  the  mo \ntion  of  sounds  will  be  slower  in  a  subduplicate  ratio  of  the  density  ;  and, \non  the  other  hand,  swifter  in  the  summer. Now  by  experiments  it  actually  appears  that  sounds  do  really  advance \nin  one  second  of  time  about  1142  feet  of  English  measure,  or  1070  feet  of \nFrench  measure. The  velocity  of  sounds  being  known,  the  intervals  of  the  pulses  are  known \nalso. For  M. Sauveur,  by  some  experiments  that  he  made,  found  that  an \nopen  pipe  about  five  Paris  feet  in  length  gives  a  sound  of  the  same  tone \nwith  a  viol-string  that  vibrates  a  hundred  times  in  one  second.", "ound  of  the  same  tone \nwith  a  viol-string  that  vibrates  a  hundred  times  in  one  second. Therefore \nthere  are  near  10J  pulses  in  a  space  of  1070  Paris  feet,  which  a  sound  runs \nover  in  asecond  of  time ;  and  therefore  one  pulse  fills  up  a  space  of  about  1 0T7-0 \nParis  feet,  that  is,  about  twice  the  length  of  the  pipe. From  whence  it  is \nprobable  that  the  breadths  of  the  pulses,  in  all  sounds  made  in  open  pipes, \nare  equal  to  twice  the  length  of  the  pipes. Moreover,  from  the  Corollary  of  Prop. XLVIt  appears  the  reason  why \nthe  sounds  immediately  cease  with  the  motion  of  the  sonorous  body,  and \nwhy  they  are  heard  no  longer  when  we  are  at  a  great  distance  from  the \nsonorous  bodies  than  when  we  are  very  near  them. And  besides,  from  the \nforegoing  principles,  it  plainly  appears  how  it  comes  to  pass  that  sounds  are \nso  mightily  increased  in  speaking-trumpets ;  for  all  reciprocal  motion  usea \nto  be  increased  by  the  generating  cause  at  each  return. And  in  tubes  hin \ndering  the  dilatation  of  the  sounds,  the  motion  decays  more  slowly,  and \n24", "370 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BOOK  II. recurs  more  forcibly ;  and  therefore  is  the  more  increased  by  the  new  mo \ntion  impressed  at  each  return.

The  resistance  arising  from  the  want  of  lubricity  in  the  parts  of  a  fluid, \nis,  casteris  paribus,  proportional  to  the  velocity  with  which  the  parts  of \nthe  fluid  are  separated  fro?n  each  other. PROPOSITION  LI. THEOREM  XXXIX. If  a  solid  cylinder  infinitely  long,  in  an  uniform  and  infinite  fluid,  revolve \nwith  an  uniform  motion  about  an  axis  given  in  position,  and  the  fluid \nbe  forced  round  by  only  this  impulse  of  the  cylinder,  and  every  part \nof  the  fluid  persevere  uniformly  in  its  'motion  ;  I  say,  that  the  periodic \ntimes  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid  are  as  their  distances  Jrom  the  axis  of \nthe  cylinder. Let  AFL  be  a  cylinder  turning  uni \nformly  about  the  axis  S,  arid  let  the \nconcentric  circles  BGM,  CHN,  DIO, \nEKP,  &c.,  divide  the  fluid  into  innu \nmerable  concentric  cylindric  solid  orbs \nof  the  same  thickness.", "vide  the  fluid  into  innu \nmerable  concentric  cylindric  solid  orbs \nof  the  same  thickness. Then,  because \nthe  fluid  is  homogeneous,  the  impres \nsions  which  the  contiguous  orbs  make \nupon  each  other  mutually  will  be  (by \nthe  Hypothesis)  as  their  translations \nfrom  each,  other,  and  as  the  contiguous \nsuperficies  upon  which  the  impressions \nare  made. If  the  impression  made  upon  any  orb  be  greater  or  less  on  its \nconcave  than  on  its  convex  side,  the  stronger  impression  will  prevail,  and \nwill  either  accelerate  or  retard  the  motion  of  the  orb,  according  as  it  agrees \nwith,  or  is  contrary  to,  the  motion  of  the  same. Therefore,  that  every  orb \nmay  persevere  uniformly  in  its  motion,  the  impressions  made  on  both  sides \nmust  be  equal  and  their  directions  contrary. Therefore  since  the  impres \nsions  are  as  the  contiguous  superficies,  and  as  their  translations  from  one \nanother,  the  translations  will  be  inversely  as  the  superficies,  that  is,  inversely \nas  the  distances  of  the  superficies  from  the  axis.

Q.E.D. COR. 1. Hence  the  angular  motions  of  the  particles  of  the  fluid  are  re \nciprocally  as  their  distances  from  the  axis  of  the  cylinder,  and  the  absolute \nvelocities  are  equal. COR. 2. If  a  fluid  be  contained  in  a  cylindric  vessel  of  an  infinite  length, \nand  contain  another  cylinder  within,  and  both  the  cylinders  revolve  about \none  common  axis,  and  the  times  of  their  revolutions  be  as  their  semi- \ndiameters,  and  every  part  of  the  fluid  perseveres  in  its  motion,  the  peri \nodic  times  of  the  several  parts  will  be  as  the  distances  from  the  axis  of  the \ncylinders.

If  there  be  added  or  taken  away  any  common  quantity  of  angu \nlar  motion  from  the  cylinder  and  fluid  moving  in  this  manner;  yet  because \nthis  new  motion  will  not  alter  the  mutual  attrition  of  the  parts  of  the  fluid, \nthe  motion  of  the  parts  among  themselves  will  not  be  changed;  for  the \ntranslations  of  the  parts  from  one  another  depend  upon  the  attrition.", "changed;  for  the \ntranslations  of  the  parts  from  one  another  depend  upon  the  attrition. Any  part  will  persevere  in  that  motion,  which,  by  the  attrition  made \non  both  sides  with  contrary  directions ,  is  no  more  accelerated  than  it  is  re \ntarded. COR. 4. Therefore  if  there  be  taken  away  from  this  whole  system  of  the \ncylinders  and  the  fluid  all  the  angular  motion  of  the  outward  cylinder,  we \nshall  have  the  motion  of  the  fluid  in  a  quiescent  cylinder. COR. 5. Therefore  if  the  fluid  and  outward  cylinder  are  at  rest,  and  the \ninward  cylinder  revolve  uniformly,  there  will  be  communicated  a  circular \nmotion  to  the  fluid,  which  will  be  propagated  by  degrees  through  the  whole \nfluid ;  and  will  go  on  continually  increasing,  till  such  time  as  the  several \nparts  of  the  fluid  acquire  the  motion  determined  in  Cor. 4.

In  all  these  reasonings  I  suppose  the  fluid  to  consist  of  matter  of  uniform \ndensity  and  fluidity ;  I  mean,  that  the  fluid  is  such,  that  a  globe  placed \nany  where  therein  may  propagate  with  the  same  motion  of  its  own,  at  dis \ntances  from  itself  continually  equal,  similar  and  equal  motions  in  the  fluid \nin  the  same  interval  of  time. The  matter  by  its  circular  motion  endeavours \nto  recede  from  the  axis  of  the  vortex,  and  therefore  presses  all  the  matter \nthat  lies  beyond. This  pressure  makes  the  attrition  greater,  and  the \nSeparation  of  the  parts  more  difficult ;  and  by  consequence  diminishes \nthe  fluidity  of  the  matter. Again  ;  if  the  parts  of  the  fluid  are  in  any  one \nplace  denser  or  larger  than  in  the  others,  the  fluidity  will  be  less  in  that \n[lace,  because  there  are  fewer  superficies  where  the  parts  can  be  separated", "\u2022fclC     IX.]  Or    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 3?< \nfrom  each  other. In  these  cases  I  suppose  the  defect  of  the  fluidity  to  be \nsupplied  by  the  smoothness  or  softness  of  the  parts,  or  some  other  condi \ntion  ;  otherwise  the  matter  where  it  is  less  fluid  will  cohere  more,  and  be \nmore  sluggish,  and  therefore  will  receive  the  motion  more  slowly,  and  pro \npagate  it  farther  than  agrees  with  the  ratio  above  assigned. If  the  vessel \nbe  riot  spherical,  the  particles  will  move  in  lines  not  circular,  but  answer \ning  to  the  figure  of  the  vessel ;  and  the  periodic  times  will  be  nearly  as  the \nsquares  of  the  mean  distances  from  the  centre. In  the  parts  between  the \ncentre  and  the  circumference  the  motions  will  be  slower  where  the  spaces \nare  wide,  and  swifter  where  narrow ;  but  yet  the  particles  will  not  tend  to  the \ncircumference  at  all  the  more  for  their  greater  swiftness ;  for  they  then \ndescribe  arcs  of  less  curvity,  and  the  conatus  of  receding  from  the  centre  is \nas  much  diminished  by  the  diminution  of  this  curvature  as  it  is  augment \ned  by  the  increase  of  the  velocity.", "the  diminution  of  this  curvature  as  it  is  augment \ned  by  the  increase  of  the  velocity. As  they  go  out  of  narrow  into  wide \nspaces,  they  recede  a  little  farther  from  the  centre,  but  in  doing  so  are  re \ntarded  ;  and  when  they  come  out  of  wide  into  narrow  spaces,  they  are  again \naccelerated ;  and  so  each  particle  is  retarded  and  accelerated  by  turns  for \never.

And  these  rules  obtain  also  with  the \ngreatest  accuracy,  as  far  as  has  been  yet  discovered  by  astronomical  obser- \ntion. Therefore  if  those  planets  are  carried  round  in  vortices  revolving \nabout  Jupiter  and  the  sun,  the  vortices  must  revolve  according  to  that \nlaw.", "revolving \nabout  Jupiter  and  the  sun,  the  vortices  must  revolve  according  to  that \nlaw. But  here  we  found  the  periodic  times  of  the  parts  of  the  vortex  to \nbe  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  distances  from  the  centre  of  motion  ;  and \nthis  ratio  cannot  be  diminished   and  reduced  to   the  sesquiplicate,  unless \neither  the  matter  of  the  vortex  be  more  fluid  the  farther  it  is  from  the  cen \ntre,  or  the  resistance  arising  from  the  want  of  lubricity  in  the  parts  of  the \nfluid  should,  as  the  velocity  with  which  the  parts  of  the  fluid  are  separated \ngoes  on  increasing,  be  augmented  with  it  in  a  greater  ratio  than  that  in \nwhich  the  velocity  increases.

And  again  ;  if  a  congealed \nor  solid  part  of  the  vortex  be  of  the  same  density  with  the  rest  of  the  vortex, \nand  be  resolved  into  a  fluid,  this  will  move  according  to  the  same  law  as \nbefore,  except  in  so  far  as  its  particles,  now  become  fluid,  may  be  moved \namong  themselves.", ",  except  in  so  far  as  its  particles,  now  become  fluid,  may  be  moved \namong  themselves. Neglect,  therefore,  the  motion  of  the  particles  among \nthemselves  as  not  at  all  concerning  the  progressive  motion  of  the  whole,  and \nthe  motion  of  the  whole  will  be  the  same  as  before. But  this  motion  will  be \nthe  same  with  the  motion  of  other  parts  of  the  vortex  at  equal  distances \nfrom  the  centre;  because  the  solid,  now  resolved  into  a  fluid,  is  become \nperfectly  like  to  the  other  parts  of  the  vortex. Therefore  a  solid,  if  it  be \nof  the  same  density  with  the  matter  of  the  vortex,  will  move  with  the  same \nmotion  as  the  parts  thereof,  being  relatively  at  rest  in  the  matter  that  sur \nrounds  it. If  it  be  more  dense,  it  will  endeavour  more  than  before  to  re \ncede  from  the  centre ;  and  therefore  overcoming  that  force  of  the  vortex, \nby  which,  being,  as  it  were,  kept,  in  equilibrio,  it  was  retained  in  its  orbit, \nit  will  recede  from  the  centre,  and  in  its  revolution  describe  a  spiral,  re \nturning  no  longer  into  the  same  orbit.

Therefore  it  can  never  con \ntinually  go  round  in  the  same  orbit,  unless  it  be  of  the  same  density  with \nthe  fluid. But  we  have  shewn  in  that  case  that  it  would  revolve  accord \ning  to  the  same  law  with  those  parts  of  the  fluid  that  are  at  the  same  or \nequal  distances  from  the  centre  of  the  vortex. COR. 1. Therefore  a  solid  revolving  in  a  vortex,  and  continually  going \nround  in  the  same  orbit,  is  relatively  quiescent  in  the  fluid  that  carries  it. COR. 2. And  if  the  vortex  be  of  an  uniform  density,  the  same  body  may \nrevolve  at  any  distance  from  the  centre  of  the  vortex. SCHOLIUM. Hence  it  is  manifest  that  the  planets  are  not  carried  round  in  corporeal \nvortices ;  for,  according  to  the  Copernican  hypothesis,  the  planets  going", "SEC.

But \nnow  the  parts  of  a  vortex  can  never  re \nvolve  with  such  a  motion. Let  AD, \nBE,  CF,  represent  three  orbits  describ \ned  about  the  sun  S,  of  which  let  the \nutmost  circle  CF  be  concentric  to  the \nsun  ;  and  let  the  aphelia  of  the  two  in \nnermost  be  A,  B  j  and  their  perihelia \nD,  E. Therefore  a  body  revolving  in \nthe  orb  CF,  describing,  by  a  radius \ndrawn  to  the  sun,  areas  proportional  to \nthe  times,  will  move  with  an  uniform  motion. And,  according  to  the  laws \nof  astronomy,  the  body  revolving  in  the  orb  BE  will  move  slower  in  its \naphelion  B,  and  swifter  in  its  perihelion  E ;  whereas,  according  to  the \nlaws  of  mechanics,  the  matter  of  the  vortex  ought  to  move  more  swiftly  in \nthe  narrow  space  between  A  and  C  than  in  the  wide  space  between  D  and \nF ;  that  is,  more  swiftly  in  the  aphelion  than  in  the  perihelion. Now  these \ntwo  conclusions  contradict  each  other.", "in  the  aphelion  than  in  the  perihelion. Now  these \ntwo  conclusions  contradict  each  other. So  at  the  beginning  of  the  sign  of \nVirgo,  where  the  aphelion  of  Mars  is  at  present,  the  distance  between  the* \norbits  of  Mars  and  Venus  is  to  the  distance  between  the  same  orbits,  at  the \nbeginning  of  the  sign  of  Pisces,  as  about  3  to  2 ;  and  therefore  the  matter \nof  the  vortex  between  those  orbits  ought  to  be  swifter  at  the  beginning  of \nPisces  than  at  the  beginning  of  Virgo  in  the  ratio  of  3  to  2  ;  for  the  nar \nrower  the  space  is  through  which  the  same  quantity  of  matter  passes  in  the \nsame  time  of  one  revolution,  the  greater  will  be  the  velocity  with  which  it \npasses  through  it. Therefore  if  the  earth  being  relatively  at  rest  in  this \ncelestial  matter  should  be  carried  round  by  it,  and  revolve  together  with  it \nabout  the  sun,  the  velocity  of  the  earth  at  the  beginning  of  Pisces \nwould  be  to  its  velocity  at  the  beginning  of  Virgo  in  a  sesquialteral  ratio.", "f  Pisces \nwould  be  to  its  velocity  at  the  beginning  of  Virgo  in  a  sesquialteral  ratio.

To  this  purpose  the  philosophers  say  that  Nature  does  nothing  in  vain, \nand  more  is  in  vain  when  less  will  serve ;  for  Nature  is  pleased  with  sim \nplicity,  and  affects  not  the  pomp  of  superfluous  causes.

RULE  III. The  qualities  of  bodies,  which  admit  neither  intension  nor  remission  oj \ndegrees,  and  which  are  found  to  belong  to  all  bodies  within  the  reach \nof  our  experiments,  are  to  be  esteemed  the  universal  qualities  of  all \nbodies  whatsoever. For  since  the  qualities  of  bodies  are  only  known  to  us  by  experiments,  we \nare  to  hold  for  universal  all  such  as  universally  agree  with  experiments  ; \nnnd  such  as  are  not  liable  to  diminution  can  never  be  quite  taken  away.", "experiments  ; \nnnd  such  as  are  not  liable  to  diminution  can  never  be  quite  taken  away. We  are  certainly  not  to  relinquish  the  evidence  of  experiments  for  the  sake \nof  dreams  and  vain  fictions  of  our  own  devising ;  nor  are  we  to  recede  from \nthe  analogy  of  Nature,  which  uses  to  be  simple,  and  always  consonant  to \nitself. We  no  other  way  know  the  extension  of  bodies  than  by  our  senses, \nnor  do  these  reach  it  in  all  bodies;  but  because  we  perceive  extension  in \nall  that  are  sensible,  therefore  we  ascribe  it  universally  to  all  others  also. That  abundance  of  bodies  are  hard,  we  learn  by  experience ;  and  because \nthe  hardness  of  the  whole  arises  from  the  hardness  of  the  parts,  we  therefore \njustly  infer  the  hardness  of  the  undivided  particles  not  only  of  the  bodies \nwe  feel  but  of  all  others. That  all  bodies  are  impenetrable,  we  gather  not \nfrom  reason,  but  from  sensation.

The  extension,  hardness,  impenetrability,  mo \nbility,  and  vis  inertia  of  the  whole,  result  from  the  extension,  hardness, \nimpenetrability,  mobility,  and  vires  inertia  of  the  parts;  and  thence  we \nconclude  the  least  particles  of  all  bodies  to  be  also  all  extended,  and  hard \nand  impenetrable,  and  moveable,  and  endowed  with  their  proper  vires  inertia. And  this  is  the  foundation  of  all  philosophy. Moreover,  that  the  divided \nbut  contiguous  particles  of  bodies  may  be  separated  from  one  another,  is \nmatter  of  observation ;  and,  in  the  particles  that  remain  undivided,  our \nminds  are  able  to  distinguish  yet  lesser  parts,  as  is  mathematically  demon \nstrated. But  whether  the  parts  so  distinguished,  and  not  yet  divided,  may, \nby  the  powers  of  Nature,  be  actually  divided  and  separated  from  one  an \nother,  we  cannot  certainly  determine. Yet,  had  we  the  proof  of  but  one \nexperiment  that  any  undivided  particle,  in  breaking  a  hard  and  solid  body, \nsuffered  a  division,  we  might  by  virtue  of  this  rule  conclude  that  the  un \ndivided  as  well  as  the  divided  particles  may  be  divided  and  actually  sep \narated  to  infinity.", "as  well  as  the  divided  particles  may  be  divided  and  actually  sep \narated  to  infinity. Lastly,  if  it  universally  appears,  by  experiments  and  astronomical  obser \nvations,  that  all  bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth,  and \nthat  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  of  matter  which  they  severally  contain ; \nthat  the  moon  likewise,  according  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  gravitates \ntowards  the  earth ;  that,  on  the  other  hand,  our  sea  gravitates  towards  the \nmoon ;  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  towards  another ;  and  the  comets \nin  like  manner  towards  the  sun  ;  we  must,  in  consequence  of  this  rule,  uni \nversally  allow  that  all  bodies  whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a  principle  ot \nmutual  gravitation. For  the  argument  from  the  appearances  concludes  with \nmore  force  for  the  universal  gravitation  of  all  bodies  than  for  their  impen \netrability  ;  of  which,  among  those  in  the  celestial  regions,  we  have  no  ex \nperiments,  nor  any  manner  of  observation.

That  Mars  sur \nrounds  the  sun,  is  as  plain  from  its  full  face  when  near  its  conjunction  with \nthe  sun. and  from  the  gibbous  figure  which  it  shews  in  its  quadratures. And  the  same  thing  is  demonstrable  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  from  their  ap \npearing  full  in  all  situations ;  for  the  shadows  of  their  satellites  that  appear \nsometimes  upon  their  disks  make  it  plain  that  the  light  they  shine  with  is \nnot  their  own,  but  borrowed  from  the  sun. PHENOMENON  IV.", "the  light  they  shine  with  is \nnot  their  own,  but  borrowed  from  the  sun. PHENOMENON  IV. That  the  fixed  stars  being  at  rest,  the  periodic  times  of  the  five  primary \nplanets,  and  (whether  of  the  suit  about  the  earth,  or)  of  the  earth  about \nthe  sun,  are  in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  mean  distances \nfrom  the  sun. This  proportion,  first  observed  by  Kepler,  is  now  received  by  all  astron \nomers  ;  for  the  periodic  times  are  the  same,  and  the  dimensions  of  the  orbits \nare  the  same,  whether  the  sun  revolves  about  the  earth,  or  the  earth  about \nthe  sun. And  as  to  the  measures  of  the  periodic  times,  all  astronomers  are \nagreed  about  them. But  for  the  dimensions  of  the  orbits,  Kepler  and  Bul- \nlialdns,  above  all  others,  have  determined  them  from  observations  with  the \ngreatest  accuracy ;  and  the  mean  distances  corresponding  to  the  periodic \ntimes  differ  but  insensibly  from  those  which  they  have  assigned,  and  for \nthe  most  part  fall  in  between  them ;  as  we  may  see  from  the  following  table.

As  to  Mercury  and  Venus,  there  can  be  no  doubt  about  their  distances \nfrom  the  sun ;  for  they  are  determined  by  the  elongations  of  those  planets \nfrom  the  sun ;  and  for  the  distances  of  the  superior  planets,  all  dispute  is \ncut  off  by  the  eclipses  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter. For  by  those  eclipses \nthe  position  of  the  shadow  which  Jupiter  projects  is  determined ;  whence \nwe  have  the  heliocentric  longitude  of  Jupiter. And  from  its  helio \ncentric  and  geocentric  longitudes  compared  together,  we  determine  its \ndistance. PHENOMENON  V. Then  the  primary  planets,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  earth,  describe  areas  no \nwise  proportional  to  the  times  ;  but  that  the  areas  which  they  describe \nby  radii  drawn  to  the  snn  are  proportional  to  the  times  of  descrip \ntion. For  to  the  earth  they  appear  sometimes  direct,  sometimes  stationary, \nnay,  and  sometimes  retrograde.", "earth  they  appear  sometimes  direct,  sometimes  stationary, \nnay,  and  sometimes  retrograde. But  from  the  sun  they  are  always  seen \ndirect,  and  to  proceed  with  a  motion  nearly  uniform,  that  is  to  say,  a  little \nswifter  in  the  perihelion  and  a  little  slower  in  the  aphelion  distances,  so  as \nto  maintain  an  equality  in  the  description  of  the  areas. This  a  noted \nproposition  among  astronomers,  and  particularly  demonstrable  in  Jupiter, \nfrom  the  eclipses  of  his  satellites;  by  the  help  of  which  eclipses,  as  we  have \nsaid,  the  heliocentric  longitudes  of  that  planet,  and  its  distances  from  the \nsun,  are  determined. PHENOMENON  VI. That  the  moon,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  earths  centre,  describes  an  area \nproportional  to  the  time  of  description. This  we  gather  from  the  apparent  motion  of  the  moon,  compared  with \nits  apparent  diameter. It  is  true  that  the  motion  of  the  moon  is  a  little \ndisturbed  by  the  action  of  the  sun :  but  in  laying  down  these  Phenomena \nI  neglect  those  imall  and  inconsiderable  errors.", "390  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nPROPOSITIONS- \nPROPOSITION  I.

The  former  part  of  this  Proposition  appears  from  Pham. I,  and  Prop. II  or  III,  Book  I :  the  latter  from  Phaen. I,  and  Cor. 6,  Prop. IV,  of  the  same \nBook.

II,  Book  I ;  the  latter  from  Phaen. IV,  and  Cor. 6,  Prop. IV,  of  the \nsame  Book. But  this  part  of  the  Proposition  is,  with  great  accuracy,  de \nmonstrable  from  the  quiescence  of  the  aphelion  points ;  for  a  very  small \naberration  from  the  reciprocal  duplicate  proportion  would  (by  Cor. 1,  Prop. XLV,  Book  I)  produce  a  motion  of  the  apsides  sensible  enough  in  every \nsingle  revolution,  and  in  many  of  them  enormously  great. PROPOSITION  III. THEOREM  III.

The  former  part  of  the  Proposition  is  evident  from  Pha3n. VI,  and  Prop.

For  (by  Cor. 1. Prop. XLV,  Book  I)  it  ap \npears,  that,  if  the  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  earth's  centre  is  to  the \nsemi-diameter  of  the  earth  as  D  to  1,  the  force,  from  which  such  a  motion \nwill  result,  is  reciprocally  as  D2^f  3,  i.", "to  1,  the  force,  from  which  such  a  motion \nwill  result,  is  reciprocally  as  D2^f  3,  i. e.,  reciprocally  as  the  power  of  D, \nwhose  exponent  is  2^^  ;  that  is  to  say,  in  the  proportion  of  the  distance \nsomething  greater  than  reciprocally  duplicate,  but  which  comes  59f  time? nearer  to  the  duplicate  than  to  the  triplicate  proportion. But  in  regard \nthat  this  motion  is  owinsr  to  the  action  of  the  sun  (as  we  shall  afterwards", "BOOK  III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 391 \nshew),  it  is  here  to  be  neglected. The  action  of  the  sun,  attracting  the \nmoon  from  the  earth,  is  nearly  as  the  moon's  distance  from  the  earth ;  and \ntherefore  (by  what  we  have  shewed  in  Cor. 2,  Prop. XLV. Book  I)  is  to  the \ncentripetal  force  of  the  moon  as  2  to  357,45,  or  nearly  so ;  that  is,  as  1  to \n178\u00a3  f-  . And  if  we  neglect  so  inconsiderable  a  force  of  the  sun,  the  re \nmaining  force,  by  which  the  moon  is  retained  in  its  orb,  will  be  recipro \ncally  as  D2. This  will  yet  more  fully  appear  from  comparing  this  force \nwith  the  force  of  gravity,  as  is  done  in  the  next  Proposition. COR. If  we  augment  the  mean  centripetal  force  by  which  the  moon  is \nretained  in  its  orb,  first  in  the  proportion  of  177%$  to  178ff,  and  then  in \nthe  duplicate  proportion  of  the  semi-diameter  of  the  earth  to  the  mean  dis \ntance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and  earth,  we  shall  have  the  centripetal \nforce  of  the  moon  at  the  surface  of  the  earth  ;  supposing  this  force,  in  de \nscending  to  the  earth's  surface,  continually  to  increase  in  the  reciprocal \nduplicate  proportion  of  the  height. PROPOSITION  IV. THEOREM  IV.", "increase  in  the  reciprocal \nduplicate  proportion  of  the  height. PROPOSITION  IV. THEOREM  IV. That  the  moon  gravitates  towards  the  earth,  and  by  thejorce  oj  gravity \nis  continually  drawn  off  from  a  rectilinear  motion,  and  retained  in \nits  orbit. The  mean  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  earth  in  the  syzygies  in  semi- \ndiameters  of  the  earth,  is,  according  to  Ptolemy  and  most  astronomers, \n59  :  according  to  Vendelin  and  Huygens,  60  ;  to  Copernicus,  60 1 ;  to \nStreet,  60| ;  and  to  Tycho,  56|. But  Tycho,  and  all  that  follow  his  ta \nbles  of  refraction,  making  the  refractions  of  the  sun  and  moon  (altogether \nagainst  the  nature  of  light)  to  exceed  the  refractions  of  the  fixed  stars,  and \nthat  by  four  or  five  minutes  near  the  horizon,  did  thereby  increase  the \nmoon's  horizontal  parallax  by  a  like  number  of  minutes,  that  is,  by  a \ntwelfth  or  fifteenth  part  of  the  whole  parallax. Correct  this  error,  and \nthe  distance  will  become  about  60^  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  near  to \nwhat  others  have  assigned. Let  us  assume  the  mean  distance  of  60  diam \neters  in  the  syzygies ;  and  suppose  one  revolution  of  the  moon,  in  respect \nof  the  fixed  stars,  to  be  completed  in  27d. 7h.", "ne  revolution  of  the  moon,  in  respect \nof  the  fixed  stars,  to  be  completed  in  27d. 7h. 43',  as  astronomers  have  de \ntermined  ;  and  the  circumference  of  the  earth  to  amount  to  123249600 \nParis  feet,  as  the  French  have  found  by  mensuration. And  now  if  we \nimagine  the  moon,  deprived  of  all  motion,  to  be  let  go,  so  as  to  descend \ntowards  the  earth  with  the  impulse  of  all  that  force  by  which  (by  Cor. Prop. Ill)  it  is  retained  in  its  orb,  it  will  in  the  space  of  one  minute  of  time, \ndescribe  in  its  fall  15T^  Paris  feet. This  we  gather  by  a  calculus,  founded \neither  upon  Prop. XXXVI,  Book  [,  or  (which  comes  to  the  same  thing; \nupon  Cor. 9,  Prop. IV,  of  the  same  Book. For  the  versed  sine  of  that  arc, \nwhich  the  moon,  in  the  space  of  one  minute  of  time,  would  by  its  mean", "392  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nmotion  describe  at  the  distance  of  60  seini-diameters  of  the  earth,  is  nearly \n15^  Paris  feet,  or  more  accurately  15  feet,  1  inch,  and  1  line  \u00a3. Where \nfore,  since  that  force,  in  approaching  to  the  earth,  increases  in  the  recipro \ncal  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance,  and,  upon  that  account,  at  the \nsurface  of  the  earth,  is  60  X  60  times  greater  than  at  the  moon,  a  body \nin  our  regions,  falling  with  that  force,  ought  in  the  space  of  one  minute  of \ntime,  to  describe  60  X  60  X  15T]\u00a5  Paris  feet;  and,  in  the  space  of  one  sec \nond  of  time,  to  describe  15 ,\\  of  those  feet;  or  more  accurately  15  feet,  1 \ninch,  and  1  line  f . And  with  this  very  force  we  actually  find  that  bodies \nhere  upon  earth  do  really  descend  :  for  a  pendulum  oscillating  seconds  in \nthe  latitude  of  Paris  will  be  3  Paris  feet,  and  8  lines  1  in  length,  as  Mr. Hu.y  veus  has  observed. And  the  space  which  a  heavy  body  describes \nby  falling  in  one  second  of  time  is  to  half  the  length  of  this  pendulum  in \nthe  duplicate  ratio  of  the  circumference  of  a  circie  to  its  diameter  (as  Mr. Htiy^ens  has  also  shewn),  and  is  therefore  15  Paris  feet,  I  inch,  1  line  J.", "(as  Mr. Htiy^ens  has  also  shewn),  and  is  therefore  15  Paris  feet,  I  inch,  1  line  J. And  therefore  the  force  by  which  the  moon  is  retained  in  its  orbit  becomes, \nat  the  very  surface  of  the  earth,  equal  to  the  force  of  gravity  which  we  ob \nserve  in  heavy  bodies  there. And  therefore  (by  Rule  I  and  II)  the  force  by \nwhich  the  moon  is  retained  in  its  orbit  is  that  very  same  force  which  we \ncommonly  call  gravity  ;  for,  were  gravity  another  force  different  from  that, \nthen  bodies  descending  to  the  earth  with  the  joint  impulse  of  both  forces \nwould  fall  with  a  double  velocity,  and  in  the  space  of  one  second  of  time \nwould  describe  30^  Paris  feet ;  altogether  against  experience. This  calculus  is  founded  on  the  hypothesis  of  the  earth's  standing  still ; \nfor  if  both  earth  and  moon  move  about  the  sun. and  at  the  same  time  about \ntheir  common  centre  of  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  moon  and \nearth  from  one  another  will  be  6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ;  as  may \nbe  found  by  a  computation  from  Prop. LX,  Book  I. SCHOLIUM. The  demonstration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained \nafter  the  following  manner.", "stration  of  this  Proposition  may  be  more  diffusely  explained \nafter  the  following  manner. Suppose  several  moons  to  revolve  about  the \nearth,  as  in  the  system  of  Jupiter  or  Saturn :  the  periodic  times  of  these \nmoons  (by  the  argument  of  induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which \nKepler  found  to  obtain  among  the  planets ;  and  therefore  their  centripetal \nforces  would  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances  from  the  centre \nof  the  earth,  by  Prop. I,  of  this  Book. Now  if  the  lowest  of  these  were \nvery  small,  and  were  so  near  the  earth  as  almost  to  touo  the  tops  of  the \nhighest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof,  retaining  it  in  its  orb, \nwould  be  very  nearly  equal  to  the  weights  of  any  terrestrial  bodies  that \nshould  be  found  upon  the  tops  of  those  mountains,  as  may  be  known  by \nthe  foregoing  computation. Therefore  if  the  same  little  moon  should  be \ndeserted  by  its  centrifugal  force  that  carries  it  through  its  orb,  and  so  be", "BOOK  111.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 393 \nlisabled  from  going  onward  therein,  it  would  descend  to  the  earth ;  and \nthat  with  the  same  velocity  as  heavy  bodies  do  actually  fall  with  upo-n  the \ntops  of  those  very  mountains ;  because  of  the  equality  of  the  forces  that \noblige  them  both  to  descend. And  if  the  force  by  which  that  lowest  moon \nwould  descend  were  different  from  gravity,  and  if  that  moon  were  to  gravi \ntate  towards  the  earth,  as  we  find  terrestrial  bodies  do  upon  the  tops  of \nmountains,  it  would  then  descend  with  twice  the  velocity,  as  being  impel \nled  by  both  these  forces  conspiring  together. Therefore  since  both  these \nforces,  that  is,  the  gravity  of  heavy  bodies,  and  the  centripetal  forces  of  the \nmoons,  respect  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and  are  similar  and  equal  between \nthemselves,  they  will  (by  Rule  I  and  II)  have  one  and  the  same  cause. And \ntherefore  the  force  which  retains  the  moon  in  its  orbit  is  that  very  force \nwhich  we  commonly  call  gravity  ;  because  otherwise  this  little  moon  at  the \ntop  of  a  mountain  must  either  be  without  gravity,  or  fall  twice  as  swiftly \nas  heavy  bodies  are  wont  to  do. PROPOSITION  V. THEOREM  V.", "ty,  or  fall  twice  as  swiftly \nas  heavy  bodies  are  wont  to  do. PROPOSITION  V. THEOREM  V. 'Vhat  the  cir  cum  jovial  planets  gravitate  towards  Jupiter  ;  the  circnntsat- \nurnal  towards  Saturn  ;  the  circumsolar  towards  the  sun  ;  and  by  t/ie \nforces  of  their  gravity  are  drawn  off  from  rectilinear  motions,  and  re \ntained  in  curvilinear  orbits. For  the  revolutions  of  the  circumjovial  planets  about  Jupiter,  of  the \ncircumsaturnal  about  Saturn,  and  of  Mercury  and  Venus,  and  the  other \ncircumsolar  planets,  about  the  sun,  are  appearances  of  the  same  sort  with \nthe  revolution  of  the  moon  about  the  earth ;  and  therefore,  by  Rule  II, \nmust  be  owing  to  the  same  sort  of  causes ;  especially  since  it  has  been \ndemonstrated,  that  the  forces  upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to \nthe  centres  of  Jupiter,  of  Saturn,  and  of  the  sun ;  and  that  those  forces,  in \nreceding  from  Jupiter,  from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun,  decrease  in  the  same \nproportion,  and  according  to  the  same  law,  as  the  force  of  gravity  does  in \nreceding  from  the  earth.

And  since  all  attraction  (by  Law  III)  is \nmutual,  Jupiter  will  therefore  gravitate  towards  all  his  own  satellites,  Sat \nurn  towards  his,  the  earth  towards  the  moon,  and  the  sun  towards  all  the \nprimary  planets.

So  the  sun  disturbs  the  motions  of  the  moon ;  and  both  sun  ini \nmoon  disturb  our  sea,  as  we  shall  hereafter  explain. SCHOLIUM.

It  has  been,  now  of  a  long  time,  observed  by  others,  that  all  sorts  of \nheavy  bodies  (allowance  being  made  for  the  inequality  of  retardation  which \nthey  suffer  from  a  small  power  of  resistance  in  the  air)  descend  to  the \nearth  from  equal  heights  in  equal  times;  and  that  equality  of  times  we \nmay  distinguish  to  a  great  accuracy,  by  the  help  of  pendulums. I  tried  the \nthing  in  gold,  silver,  lead,  glass,  sand,  eommpn  salt,  wood,  water,  and  wheat. I  provided  two  wooden  boxes,  round  and  equal :  I  filled  the  one  with  wood, \nand  suspended  an  equal  weight  of  gold  (as  exactly  as  I  could)  in  the  centre \nof  oscillation  of  the  other. The  boxes  hanging  by  equal  threads  of  11  feet \nmade  a  couple  of  pendulums  perfectly  equal  in  weight  and  figure,  and \nequally  receiving  the  resistance  of  the  air. And,  placing  the  one  by  the \nother,  I  observed  them  to  play  together  forward  and  backward,  for  a  long \ntime,  wi  h  equal  vibrations. And  therefore  the  quantity  of  matte*  :n  the \ngold  (by  Cor. 1  and  6,  Prop.", "l  vibrations. And  therefore  the  quantity  of  matte*  :n  the \ngold  (by  Cor. 1  and  6,  Prop.

By  these  experiments,  in  bodies  of  the  same  weight,  1  could  man \nifestly  have  discovered  a  difference  of  matter  less  than  the  thousandth  part \nof  the  whol^,  had  any  such  been. But,  without  all  doubt,  the  nature  of \ngravity  towards  the  planets  is  the  same  as  towards  the  earth. For,  should \nwe  imagine  our  terrestrial  bodies  removed  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  and \nthere,  together  with  the  moon,  deprived  of  all  motion,  to  be  let  go,  so  as  to \nfall  together  towards  the  earth,  it  is  certain,  from  what  we  have  demonstra \nted  before,  that,  in  equal  times,  they  would  describe  equal  spaces  with  the \nmoon,  and  of  consequence  are  to  the  moon,  in  quantity  of  matter,  as  their \nweights  to  its  weight. Moreover,  since  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  perform", "HOOK  ill.]  or  NVTURAL  PHILOSOPHY,  395 \ntheir  revolutions  in  times  which  observe  the  sesquiphiate  pr  portion  ol \ntheir  distances  from  Jupiter's  centre,  their  accelerative  gravities  towards \nJupiter  will  be  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distances  from  Jupiter's \ncentre;  that  is,  equal,  at  equal  distances. And,  therefore,  these  satellites, \nif  supposed  to  fall  towards  Jupiter  from  equal  heights,  would  describe  equal \nspaces  in  equal  times,  in  like  manner  as  heavy  bodies  do  on  our  earth. And,  by  the  same  argument,  if  the  circumsolar  planets  were  supposed  to  be \nlet  fall  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  they  would,  in  their  descent  towards \nthe  sun,  describe  equal  spaces  in  equal  times. But  forces  which  equally \naccelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as  those  bodies  :  that  is  to  sa_y,  the  weights \n;f  the  planets  towards  the  sun  must  be  as  their  quantities  of  matter, \nfurther,  that  the  weights  of  Jupiter  and  of  his  satellites  towards  the  sun \nare  proportional  to  the  several  quantities  of  their  matter,  appears  from  the \nexceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor. 3,  Prop. LXV,  Book \n1).", "from  the \nexceedingly  regular  motions  of  the  satellites  (by  Cor. 3,  Prop. LXV,  Book \n1). For  if  some  of  those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the  sun  in \nproportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter  than  others,  the  motions  of  the  sat \nellites  would  be  disturbed  by  that  inequality  of  attraction  (by  Cor.^,  Prop. LXV,  Book  I). If,  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  any  satellite,  in  pro \nportion  to  the  quantity  of  its  matter,  did  gravitate  towards  the  sun  with  a \nforce  greater  than  Jupiter  in  proportion  to  his,  according  to  any  given  pro \nportion,  suppose  of  d  to  e  ;  then  the  distance  between  the  centres  of  the  sun \nand  of  the  satellite's  orbit  would  be  always  greater  than  the  distance  be \ntween  the  centres  of  the  sun  and  of  Jupiter  nearly  in  the  subduplicate  of \nthat  proportion  :  as  by  some  computations  I  have  found. And  if  the  sat \nellite  did  gravitate  towards  the  sun  with  a  force,  lesser  in  the  proportion  of  e \nto  d,  the  distance  of  the  centre  of  the  satellite's  orb  from  the  sun  would  be \nless  than  the  distance  of  the  centre  of  Jupiter  from  the  sun  in  the  subdu \nplicate  of  the  same  proportion.", "e  of  the  centre  of  Jupiter  from  the  sun  in  the  subdu \nplicate  of  the  same  proportion. Therefore  if,  at  equal  distances  from  the \nsun,  the  accelerative  gravity  of  any  satellite  towards  the  sun  were  greater \nor  less  than  the  accelerative  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the  sun  but  by  one  T  oV  7 \npart  of  the  whole  gravity,  the  distance  of  the  centre  of  the  satellite's  orbit \nfrom  the  sun  would  be  greater  or  less  than  the  distance  of  Jupiter  from  the \nsun  by  one  ^oVo  Part  of  the  whole  distance;  that  is,  by  a  nf  h  part  of  the \ndistance  of  the  utmost  satellite  from  the  centre  of  Jupiter ;  an  eccentricity \nof  the  orbit  which  would  be  very  sensible. But  the  orbits  of  the  satellites \nare  concentric  to  Jupiter,  and  therefore  the  accelerative  gravities  of  Jupiter, \nand  of  all  its  satellites  towards  the  sun,  are  equal  among  themselves. And \nby  the  same  argument,  the  weights  of  Saturn  and  of  his  satellites  towards \nthe  sun,  at  equal  distances  from  the  sun,  are  as  their  several  quantities  of \nmatter ;  and  the  weights  of  the  moon  and  of  the  earth  towards  the  sun  are \neither  none,  or  accurately  proportional  to  the  masses  of  matter  which  they \ncontain.

Nor  is  it  of  any  moment  whether  these  parts  are \nexternal  or  internal ;  for  if,  for  example,  we  should  imagine  the  terrestrial \nbodies  with  us  to  be  raised  up  to  the  orb  of  the  moon,  to  be  there  compared \nwith  its  body  :  if  the  weights  of  such  bodies  were  to  the  weights  of  the  ex \nternal  parts  of  the  moon  as  the  quantities  of  matter  in  the  one  and  in  the \nother  respectively  \u2022  but  to  the  weights  of  the  internal  parts  in  a  greater  or \nless  proportion,  then  likewise  the  weights  of  those  bodies  would  be  to  the \nweight  of  the  whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less  proportion;  against  what \nwe  have  shewed  above.

The  power  of  magnetism  in  one  and  the  same  body  may  be \nincreased  and  diminished ;  and  is  sometimes  far  stronger,  for  the  quantity \nof  matter,  than  the  power  of  gravity  ;  and  in  receding  from  the  magnet \ndecreases  not  in  the  duplicate  but  almost  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the \ndistance,  as  nearly  as  I  could  judge  from  some  rude  observations. PROPOSITION  VII. THEOREM  VII. That  there  is  a  power  of  gravity  tending  to  all  bodies,  proportional  to \nthe  several  quantities  of  matter  which  they  contain. That  all  the  planets  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we  have \nproved  before  ;  as  well  as  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  every  one  of  them, \nconsidered  apart,  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from \nthe  centre  of  the  planet. And  thence  (by  Prop.", "square  of  the  distance  of  places  from \nthe  centre  of  the  planet. And  thence  (by  Prop. LXIX,  Book  I,  and  its \nCorollaries)  it  follows,  that  the  gravity  tending  towards  all  the  planets  is \nproportional  to  the  matter  which  they  contain. Moreover,  since  all  the  parts  of  any  planet  A  gravitate  towards  any \nother  planet  B  ;  and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is  to  the  gravity  of  the \nwhole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole ;  and  (by  Law \nIII)  to  every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ;  therefore  the  planet  B \nwill,  on  the  other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all  the  parts  of  the  planet  A ; \nand  its  gravity  towards  any  one  part  will  be  to  the  gravity  towards  the \nwhole  as  the  matter  of  the  part  to  the  matter  of  the  whole. Q.E.D. COR,  1. Therefore  the  force  of  gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises \nfrom,  and  is  compounded  of,  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its  parts. Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ;  for  all  at \ntraction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several \nparts.", "ll  at \ntraction  towards  the  whole  arises  from  the  attractions  towards  the  several \nparts. The  thing  may  be  easily  understood  in  gravity,  if  we  consider  a \ngreater  planet,  as  formed  of  a  number  of  lesser  planets,  meeting  together  in \none  globe ;  for  hence  it  would  appear  that  the  force  of  the  whole  must \narise  from  the  forces  of  the  component  parts. If  it  is  objected,  that,  ac \ncording  to  this  law,  all  bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to \nwards  another,  whereas  no  such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I  answer, \nthat  since  the  gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is  to  the  gravitation  towards \nthe  whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to  the  whole  earth,  the  gravitation  to \nwards  them  must  be  far  less  than  to  fall  under  the  observation  of  our  senses. COR. 2. The  force  of  gravity  towards  the  several  equal  particles  of  any \nbody  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  of  places  from  the  parti \ncles  ;  as  appears  from  Cor. 3,  Prop.

After  I  had  found  that  the  force  of  gravity  towards  a  whole  planet  did \narise  from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of  gravity  towards  all  its \nparts,  and  towards  every  one  part  was  in  the  reciprocal  proportion  of  the \nsquares  of  the  distances  from  the  part,  I  was  yet  in  doubt  whether  that  re \nciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did  accurately  hold,  or  but  nearly  so,  in  the \ntotal  force  compounded  of  so  many  partial  ones;  for  it  might  be  that  the \nproportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in  greater  distances  should \nbe  wide  of  the  truth  near  the  surface  of  the  planet,  where  the  distances  of \nthe  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar. But  by  the  help \nof  Prop. LXXV  and  LXXVI,  Book  I,  and  their  Corollaries,  I  was  at  last \nsatisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  Proposition,  as  it  now  lies  before  us.

Hence  we  may  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies \ntowards  different  planets  ;  for  the  weights  of  bodies  revolving  in  circles \nabout  planets  are  (by  Cor. 2,  Prop.

Then  because  as  the  distances  are  increased  or  di \nminished,  the  weights  are  diminished  or  increased  in  a  duplicate  ratio,  the \nweights  of  equal  bodies  towards  the  sun,  Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  the  earth, \nat  the  distances  10000,  997, 791,  and  109  from  their  centres,  that  is,  at  their \nvery  superficies,  will  be  as  10000,  943,  529,  and  435  respectively. How \nmuch  the  weights  of  bodies  are  at  the  superficies  of  the  moon,  will  be \nshewn  hereafter. COR. 2. Hence  likewise  we  discover  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  several", ".BOOK    II1.J  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 39(.* \nplanets;  for  their  quantities  of  matter  are  as  the  forces  of  gravity  at  equai \ndistances  from  their  centres;  that  is,  in  the  sun,  Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  the \nearth,  as  1,  TO'FTJ  a-oVr? anc^  TeVaja  respectively.

COR. 3. Hence  also  we  find  the  densities  of  the  planets ;  for  (by  Prop. LXXII,  Book  I)  the  weights  of  equal  and  similar  bodies  towards  similar \nspheres  are,  at  the  surfaces  of  those  spheres,  as  the  diameters  of  the  spheres  5 \nand  therefore  the  densities  of  dissimilar  spheres  are  as  those  weights  applied \nto  the  diameters  of  the  spheres. But  the  true  diameters  of  the  Sun,  .Jupi \nter,  Saturn,  and  the  earth,  were  one  to  another  as  10000,  997,  791,  arid \n109;  and  the  weights  towards  the  same  as  10000,  943,  529,  and  435  re \nspectively  ;  and  therefore  their  densities  are  as  100. 94|,  67,  and  400.", ",  and  435  re \nspectively  ;  and  therefore  their  densities  are  as  100. 94|,  67,  and  400. The \ndensity  of  the  earth,  which  comes  out  by  this  computation,  does  not  depend \nupon  the  parallax  of  the  sun,  but  is  determined  by  the  parallax  of  the \nmoon,  and  therefore  is  here  truly  defined. The  sun,  therefore,  is  a  little \ndenser  than  Jupiter,  and  Jupiter  than  Saturn,  and  the  earth  four  times \ndenser  than  the  sun ;  for  the  sun,  by  its  great  heat,  is  kept  in  a  sort  of \na  rarefied  state. The  moon  is  denser  than  the  earth,  as  shall  appear  after \nward. COR. 4. The  smaller  the  planets  are,  they  are,  cccteris  parilms,  of  so \nmuch  the  greater  density ;  for  so  the  powers  of  gravity  on  their  several \nsurfaces  come  nearer  to  equality. They  are  likewise,  cccteris  paribiis,  of \nthe  greater  density,  as  they  are  nearer  to  the  sun. So  Jupiter  is  more \ndense  than  Saturn,  and  the  earth  than  Jupiter ;  for  the  planets  were  to  be \nplaced  at  different  distances  from  the  sun,  that,  according  to  their  degrees \nof  density,  they  might  enjoy  a  greater  or  less  proportion  to  the  sun's  heat.", "degrees \nof  density,  they  might  enjoy  a  greater  or  less  proportion  to  the  sun's  heat.

Nor  are  we  to  doubt  that  the  matter  of  Mercury  is  adapted  to  its \nheat,  and  is  therefore  more  dense  than  the  matter  of  our  earth ;  since,  in  a \ndenser  matter,  the  operations  of  Nature  require  a  stronger  heat. PROPOSITION  IX. THEOREM  IX. That  the  force  of  gravity,  considered  downward  from  t/ie  surface \nof  the  planets  decreases  nearly  in  the  proportion  of  the  distances  from \ntheir  centres.

The  error,", "100  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \ntherefore,  can  be  no  greater  than  what  may  arise  from  the  inequality  of \nthe  density. PROPOSITION  X. THEOREM  X. That  the  motions  of  the  planets  in  the  heavens  may  subsist  an  exceedingly \nlong  time. In  the  Scholium  of  Prop. XL,  Book  II,  I  have  shewed  that  a  globe  of \nwater  frozen  into  ice,  and  moving  freely  in  our  air,  in  the  time  that  it  would \ndescribe  the  length  of  its  semi-diameter,  would  lose  by  the  resistance  of  the \nair  \u00a53\\6  part  of  its  motion;  and  the  same  proportion  holds  nearly  in  all \nglobes,  how  great  soever,  and  moved  with  whatever  velocity. But  that  our \nglobe  of  earth  is  of  greater  density  than  it  would  be  if  the  whole \nconsisted  of  water  only,  I  thus  make  out. If  the  whole  consisted  of \nwater  only,  whatever  was  of  less  density  than  water,  because  of  its  Ivss \nspecific  gravity,  would  emerge  and  float  above. And  upon  this  account,  if \na  globe  of  terrestrial  matter,  covered  on  all  sides  with  water,  was  less  dense \nthan  water,  it  would  emerge  somewhere ;  and,  the  subsiding  water  falling \nback,  would  be  gathered  to  the  opposite  side. And  such  is  the  condition \nof  our  earth,  which  in  a  great  measure  is  covered  with  seas.", "d  such  is  the  condition \nof  our  earth,  which  in  a  great  measure  is  covered  with  seas. The  earth,  if \nit  was  not  for  its  greater  density,  would  emerge  from  the  seas,  and,  accord \ning  to  its  degree  of  levity,  would  be  raised  more  or  less  above  their  surface, \nthe  water  of  the  seas  flowing  backward  to  the  opposite  side. By  the  same \nargument,  the  spots  of  the  sun,  which  float  upon  the  lucid  matter  thereof. are  lighter  than  that  matter ;  and,  however  the  planets  have  been  formed \nwhile  they  were  yet  in  fluid  masses,  all  the  heavier  matter  subsided  to  the \ncentre. Since,  therefore,  the  common  matter  of  our  earth  on  the  surface \nthereof  is  about  twice  as  heavy  as  water,  and  a  little  lower,  in  mines,  is \nfound  about  three,  or  four,  or  even  five  times  more  heavy,  it  is  probable  that \nthe  quantity  of  the  whole  matter  of  the  earth  may  be  five  or  six  times \ngreater  than  if  it  consisted  all  of  water ;  especially  since  I  have  before \nshewed  that  the  earth  is  about  four  times  more  dense  than  Jupiter.", "ince  I  have  before \nshewed  that  the  earth  is  about  four  times  more  dense  than  Jupiter. If, \ntherefore,  Jupiter  is  a  little  more  dense  than  water,  in  the  space  of  thirty \ndays,  in  which  that  planet  describes  the  length  of  459  of  its  semi-diame \nters,  it  would,  in  a  medium  of  the  same  density  Avith  our  air,  lose  almost  a \ntenth  part  of  its  motion. But  since  the  resistance  of  mediums  decreases \nin  proportion  to  their  weight  or  density,  so  that  water,  which  is  13|  times \nlighter  than  quicksilver,  resists  less  in  that  proportion ;  and  air,  which  is \n860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less  in  the  same  proportion  ;  therefore \nin  the  heavens,  where  the  weight  of  the  medium  in  which  the  planets  move \nis  immensely  diminished,  the  resistance  will  almost  vanish. It  is  shewn  in  the  Scholium  of  Prop. XXII,  Book  II,  that  at  the  height \nof  200  miles  above  the  earth  the  air  is  more  rare  than  it  is  at  the  super \nficies  of  the  earth  in  the  ratio  of  30  to  0,0000000000003999,  or  as", "BOOK  III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 401 \n75000000000000  to  1  nearly. And  hence  the  planet  Jupiter,  revolving  in \na  medium  of  the  same  density  with  that  superior  air,  would  not  lose  by  the \nresistance  of  the  medium  the  1000000th  part  of  its  motion  in  1000000 \nyears. In  the  spaces  near  the  earth  the  resistance  is  produced  only  by  the \nair,  exhalations,  and  vapours. When  these  are  carefully  exhausted  by  the \nair-pump  from  under  the  receiver,  heavy  bodies  fall  within  the  receiver  with \nperfect  freedom,  and  without  the  le.ist  sensible  resistance:  gold  itself,  and \nthe  lightest  down,  let  fall  together,  will  descend  with  equal  velocity;  and \nthough  they  fall  through  a  space  of  four,  six,  and  eight  feet,  they  will  come \nto  the  bottom  at  the  same  time;  as  appears  from  experiments. And  there \nfore  the  celestial  regions  being  perfectly  void  of  air  and  exhalations,  the \nplanets  and  comets  meeting  no  sensible  resistance  in  those  spaces  will  con \ntinue  their  motions  through  them  for  an  immense  tract  of  time. HYPOTHESIS  I. That  the  centre  of  the  system  of  the  world  is  immovable. This   is   acknowledged   by    all,    while   some   contend    that   the   earth, \nothers  that  the  sun,  is  fixed  in   that  centre.", "hile   some   contend    that   the   earth, \nothers  that  the  sun,  is  fixed  in   that  centre. Let  us  see  what  may  from \nhence  follow. PROPOSITION  XL     THEOREM  XI. That  the  common,  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all  the \nplanets,  is  immovable. For  (by  Cor. 4  of  the  Laws)  that  centre  either  is  at  rest,  or  moves  uni \nformly  forward  in  a  right  line ;  but  if  that  centre  moved,  the  centre  of  the \nworld  would  move  also,  against  the  Hypothesis. PROPOSITION  XII. THEOREM  XII. That  the  sun  is  agitated  by  a  perpetual  motion,  but  never  recedes  jar \nfrom  the  common,  centre  of  gravity  of  all  the  planets. For  since  (by  Cor. 2,  Prop. VIII)  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  sun  is  to \nthe  quantity  of  matter  in  Jupiter  as  1067  to  1 ;  and  the  distance  of  Jupi \nter  from  the  sun  is  to  the  semi-diameter  of  the  sun  in  a  proportion  but  a \nsmall  matter  greater,  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  and  the  sun \nwill  fall  upon  a  point  a  little  without  the  surface  of  the  sun.", "Jupiter  and  the  sun \nwill  fall  upon  a  point  a  little  without  the  surface  of  the  sun. By  the  same \nargument,  since  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  sun  is  to  the  quantity  of \nmatter  in  Saturn  as  3021  to  1,  and  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  is \nto  the  semi-diameter  of  the  sun  in  a  proportion  but  a  small  matter  less, \nthe  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Saturn  and  the  sun  will  fall  upon  a  point \na  little  within  the  surface  of  the  sun. And,  pursuing  the  principles  of  this \ncomputation,  we  should  find  that  though  the  earth  and  all  the  planets  were \nplaced  on  one  side  of  the  sun,  the  distance  of  the  common  centre  of  gravity \nof  all  from  the  centre  of  the  sun  would  scarcely  amount  to  one  diameter  of \n26", "102  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nthe  sun. In  other  cases,  the  distances  of  those  centres  are  always  less :  and \ntherefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is  in  perpetual  rest,  the  sun,  accord \ning  to  the  various  positions  of  the  planets,  must  perpetually  be  moved  every \nway,  but  will  never  recede  far  from  that  centre. Con. Hence  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  earth,  the  sun,  and  all \nthe  planets,  is  to  be  esteemed  the  centre  of  the  world ;  for  since  the  earth, \nthe  sun,  and  all  the  planets,  mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and \nare  therefore,  according  to  their  powers  of  gravity,  in  perpetual  agitation, \nas  the  Laws  of  Motion  require,  it  is  plain  that  their  moveable  centres  can \nnot  be  taken  for  the  immovable  centre  of  the  world. If  that  body  were  to \nbe  placed  in  the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord \ning  to  common  opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to  be  allowed  to  the  sun;  but \nsince  the  sun  itself  is  moved,  a  fixed  point  is  to  be  chosen  from  which  the \ncentre  of  the  sun  recedes  least,  and  from  which  it  would  recede  yet \nless  if  the  body  of  the  sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt \nto  be  moved. PROPOSITION  XIII. THEOREM  XIII.", "denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less  apt \nto  be  moved. PROPOSITION  XIII. THEOREM  XIII. The  planets  move  in  ellipses  tvhicli  have  their  common  focus  in  the  centre \nof  the  sini  ;  and,  by  radii  drawn,  to  tJtat  centre,  they  describe  areas  pro \nportion  al  to  the  times  of  description. We  have  discoursed  above  of  these  motions  from  the  Phenomena. Now \nthat  we  know  the  principles  on  which  they  depend,  from  those  principles \nwe  deduce  the  motions  of  the  heavens  a  priori. Because  the  weights  of \nthe  planets  towards  the  sun  are  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  their  distan \nces  from  the  sun's  centre,  if  the  sun  was  at  rest,  and  the  other  planets  did \nnot  mutually  act  one  upon  another,  their  orbits  would  be  ellipses,  having \nthe  sun  in  their  common  focus;  and  they  would  describe  areas  proportional \nto  the  times  of  description,  by  Prop. I  and  XI,  and  Cor. 1,  Prop. XIII, \nBook  I. But  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  one  upon  another  are  so \nvery  small,  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  by  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I,  they \nless  disturb  the  motions  of  the  planets  around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if \nthose  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest.", "around  the  sun  in  motion  than  if \nthose  motions  were  performed  about  the  sun  at  rest. It  is  true,  that  the  action  of  Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is  not  to  be  neglected; \nfor  the  force  of  gravity  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  towards \nthe  sun  (at  equal  distances,  Cor. 2,  Prop. VIII)  as  1  to  1067;  and  therefore \nin  the  conjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn \nfrom  Jupiter  is  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  from  the  sun  almost  as  4  to  9,  the \ngravity  of  Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to  the  gravity  of  Saturn  towards \nthe  sun  as  81  to  16  X  1067;  or,  as  1  to  about  21 1. And  hence  arises  a \nperturbation  of  the  orb  of  Saturn  in  every  conjunction  of  this  planet  with \nTupiter,  so  sensible,  that  astronomers  are  puzzled  with  it. As  the  planet", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 403 \nis  differently  situated  in  these  conjunctions,  its  eccentricity  is  sometimes \naugmented,  sometimes  diminished;  its  aphelion  is  sometimes  carried  for \nward,  sometimes  backward,  and  its  mean  motion  is  by  turns  accelerated  and \nretarded ;  yet  the  whole  error  in  its  motion  about  the  sun,  though  arising \nfrom  so  great  a  force,  may  be  almost  avoided  (except  in  the  mean  motion) \nby  placing  the  lower  focus  of  its  orbit  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of \nJupiter  and  the  sun  (according  to  Prop. LXVII,  Book  I),  and  therefore  that \nerror,  when  it  is  greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes ;  and  the  greatest \nerror  in  the  mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly. But  in  the \nconjunction  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the  accelerative  forces  of  gravity  of  the \nsun  towards  Saturn,  of  Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of  Jupiter  towards  the \nsun,  are  almost  as  16,  81,  and  -       ~o^~~       \u2014 >  or  156609:  and  therefore \nthe  difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the  sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of \nJupiter  towards  Saturn,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the \nsun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409.", "the  force  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  towards  the \nsun  as  65  to  156609,  or  as  1  to  2409. But  the  greatest  power  of  Saturn \nto  disturb  the  motion  of  Jupiter  is  proportional  to  this  difference;  and \ntherefore  the  perturbation  of  the  orbit  of  Jupiter  is  much  less  than  that  of \nSaturn's. The  perturbations  of  the  other  orbits  are  yet  far  less,  except  that \nthe  orbit  of  the  earth  is  sensibly  disturbed  by  the  moon. The  common \ncentre  of  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  moves  in  an  ellipsis  about  the  sun \nin  the  focus  thereof,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun,  describes  areas  pro \nportional  to  the  times  of  description. But  the  earth  in  the  mean  time  by \na  menstrual  motion  is  revolved  about  this  common  centre. PROPOSITION  XIV. THEOREM  XIV. The  aphelions  and  nodes  of  the  orbits  of  the  planets  are  fixed. The  aphelions  are  immovable  by  Prop. XI,  Book  I ;  and  so  are  the \nplanes  of  the  orbits,  by  Prop. I  of  the  same  Book. And  if  the  planes  are \nfixed,  the  nodes  must  be  so  too. It  is  true,  that  some  inequalities  may \narise  from  the  mutual  actions  of  the  planets  and  comets  in  their  revolu \ntions  ;  but  these  will  be  so  small,  that  they  may  be  here  passed  by. COR. 1.", "revolu \ntions  ;  but  these  will  be  so  small,  that  they  may  be  here  passed  by. COR. 1. The  fixed  stars  are  immovable,  seeing  they  keep  the  same  posi \ntion  to  the  aphelions  and  nodes  of  the  planets. COR. 2. And  since  these  stars  are  liable  to  no  sensible  parallax  from  the \nannual  motion  of  the  earth,  they  can  have  no  force,  because  of  their  im \nmense  distance,  to  produce  any  sensible  effect  in  our  system. Not  to \nmention  that  the  fixed  stars,  every  where  promiscuously  dispersed  in  the \nheavens,  by  their  contrary  attractions  destroy  their  mutual  actions,  by \nProp. LXX,  Book  I. SCHOLIUM. Since  the  planets  near  the  sun  (viz. Mercury,  Venus,  the  Earth,  and", "404  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [B'.-OK    IIL \nMars)  are  so  small  that  they  can  act  with  but  little  force  upon  each  other, \ntherefore  their  aphelions  and  nodes  must  be  fixed,  excepting  in  so  far  as \nthey  are  disturbed  by  the  actions  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  and  other  higher \nbodies. And  hence  we  may  find,  by  the  theory  of  gravity,  that  their  aphe \nlions  move  a  little  in  consequentw,  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  and  that \nin  the  sesqui  plicate  proportion  of  their  several  distances  from  the  sun. So \nthat  if  the  aphelion  of  Mars,  in  the  space  of  a  hundred  years,  is  carried \n33'  20\"  in  consequent-la,  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  the  aphelions  of  the \nEarth,  of  Venus,  and  of  Mercury,  will  in  a  hundred  years  be  carried  for \nwards  17'  40\",  10'  53',  and  4'  16\",  respectively. But  these  motions  are \nso  inconsiderable,  that  we  have  neglected  them  in  this  Proposition, \nPROPOSITION  XV. PROBLEM  I.

LX,  Book  I. PROPOSITION  XVI. PROBLEM  II. To  find  the  eccentricities  and  aphelions  of  the  planets. This  Problem  is  resolved  by  Prop. XVIII,  Book  I. PROPOSITION  XVII. THEOREM  XV. That   the  diurnal  motions  of  the  planets  are  uniform,  and  that  the \nlibration  of  the  moon  arises  from  its  diurnal  motion. The  Proposition  is  proved  from  the  first  Law  of  Motion,  and  Cor. 22, \nProp. LXVI,  Book  I. Jupiter,  with  respect  to  the  fixed  stars,  revolves  in \n9'1. 5(5  ;  Mars  in  24h. 39' ;  Venus  in  about  23h. ;  the  Earth  in  23'1. 56' ;  the \nSun  in  25 1  days,  and  the  moon  in  27  days,  7  hours,  43'. These  things \nappear  by  the  Phasnomena. The  spots  in  the  sun's  body  return  to  the \nsame  situation  on  the  sun's  disk,  with  respect  to  the  earth,  in  27  \u00b1  days ;  and \ntherefore  with  respect  to  the  fixed  stars  the  sun  revolves  in  about  25|days.", "ays ;  and \ntherefore  with  respect  to  the  fixed  stars  the  sun  revolves  in  about  25|days. But  because  the  lunar  day,  arising  from  its  uniform  revolution  about  its \naxis,  is  menstrual,  that  is,  equal  to  the  time  of  its  periodic  revolution  in \nits  orb,  therefore  the  same  face  of  the  moon  wrill  be  always  nearly  turned  to \nthe  upper  focus  of  its  orb ;  but,  as  the  situation  of  that  focus  requires,  will \ndeviate  a  little  to  one  side  and  to  the  other  from  the  earth  in  the  lower \nfocus  j  and  this  is  the  libration  in  longitude ;  for  the  libration  in  latitude \narises  from  the  moon's  latitude,  and  the  inclination  of  its  axis  to  the  plane \nof  the  ecliptic. This  theory  of  the  libration  of  the  moon,  Mr. N. Mercato*", "BOOK  III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 4()\u00a3 \nin  his  Astronomy,  published  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  1676. explained \nmore  fully  out  of  the  letters  I  sent  him. The  utmost  satellite  of  Saturn \neeems  to  revolve  about  its  axis  with  a  motion  like  this  of  the  moon,  respect \ning  Saturn  continually  with  the  same  face;  for  in  its  revolution  round \nSaturn,  as  often  as  it  comes  to  the  eastern  part  of  its  orbit,  it  is  scarcel) \nvisible,  and  generally  quite  disappears ;  which  is  like  to  be  occasioned  by \nsome  spots  in  that  part  of  its  body,  which  is  then  turned  towards  the  earth, \nas  M. Cassini  has  observed. So  also  the  utmost  satellite  of  Jupiter  seema \nto  revolve  about  its  axis  with  a  like  motion,  because  in  that  part  of  its  body \nwhich  is  turned  from  Jupiter  it  has  a  spot,  which  always  appears  as  if  it \nwere  in  Jupiter's  own  body,  whenever  the  satellite  passes  between  Jupiter \nand  our  eye. PROPOSITION  XVIII. THEOREM  XVI. That  the  axes  of  the  planets  are  less  than  the  diameters  drawn  perpen \ndicular  to  the  axes. The  equal  gravitation  of  the  parts  on  all  sides  would  give  a  spherical \nfigure  to  the  planets,  if  it  was  not  for  their  diurnal  revolution  in  a  circle.", "erical \nfigure  to  the  planets,  if  it  was  not  for  their  diurnal  revolution  in  a  circle. By  that  circular  motion  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  parts  receding  from  the \naxis  endeavour  to  ascend  about  the  equator  ;  and  therefore  if  the  matter  is \nin  a  fluid  state,  by  its  ascent  towards  the  equator  it  will  enlarge  the  di \nameters  there,  and  by  its  descent' to  wards  the  poles  it  will  shorten  the  axis. So  the  diameter  of  Jupiter  (by  the  concurring  observations  of  astronomers) \nis  found  shorter  betwixt  pole  and  pole  than  from  east  to  west. And,  by \nthe  same  argument,  if  our  earth  was  not  higher  about  the  equator  than  at \nthe  poles,  the  seas  would  subside  about  the  poles,  and,  rising  toward*  Ikf \nequator,  would  lay  all  things  there  under  water. PROPOSITION  XIX. PROBLEM  III \nTo  find  the  proportion  of  the  axis  of  a  planet  to  the  dia  meter  j  j*,rpen- \ndici/lar  thereto. Our  countryman,  Mr. Norwood,  measuring  a  distance  of  005751  feet  of \nLondon  measure  between  London  and  YorA:,  in  1635,  and  obs,-rvino-  the \ndifference  of  latitudes  to  be  2\u00b0  28',  determined  the  measure  of  one  degree \nto  be  3671 96  feet  of  London  measure,  that  is  57300  Paris  toises.", "asure  of  one  degree \nto  be  3671 96  feet  of  London  measure,  that  is  57300  Paris  toises. M \nPicart,  measuring  an  arc  of  one  degree,  and  22'  55\"  of  the  meridian  be \ntween  Amiens  and  Malvoisine,  found  an  arc  of  one  degree  to  be  57060 \nParis  toises. M. Cassini,  the  father,  measured  the  distance  upon  the  me \nridian  from  the  town  of  Collionre  in  Roussillon  to  the  Observatory  of \nPari\u00bb;  and  his  son  added  the  distance  from  the  Observatory  to  the  Cita \ndel  of  Dunkirk. The  whole  distance  was  486156^  toises  and  the  differ \nence  of  the  latitudes  of  Collionre  and  Dunkirk  was  8  degrees,  and  31", "106  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    1IJ. llf\". Hence  an  arc  of  one  degree  appears  to  be  57061  Paris  toises. And  from  these  measures  we  conclude  that  the  circumference  of  the  earth \nis  123249600,  and  its  semi-diameter  19615800  Paris  feet,  upon  the  sup \nposition  that  the  earth  is  of  a  spherical  figure. In  the  latitude  of  Paris  a  heavy  body  falling  in  a  second  of  time  de \nscribes  15  Paris  feet,  1  inch,  1 J  line,  as  above,  that  is,  2173  lines  J. The \nweight  of  the  body  is  diminished  by  the  weight  of  the  ambient  air. Let \nus  suppose  the  weight  lost  thereby  to  be  TT^o-o-  Par^  \u00b0^  ^he  whole  weight ; \nthen  that  heavy  body  falling  in,  vacua  will  describe  a  height  of  2174  lines \nin  one  second  of  time. A  body  in  every  sidereal  day  of  23'1. 56'  4\"  uniformly  revolving  in  a \ncircle  at  the  distance  of  19615SOO  feet  from  the  centre,  in  one  second  oi \ntime  describes  an  arc  of  1433,46  feet ;  the  versed  sine  of  which  is  0,0523656 1 \nfeet,  or  7,54064  lines. And  therefore  the  force  with  which  bodies  descend \nin  the  latitude  of  Paris  is  to  the  centrifugal  force  of  bodies  in  the  equator \narising  from  the  diurnal  motion  of  the  earth  as  2174  to  7,54064.", "odies  in  the  equator \narising  from  the  diurnal  motion  of  the  earth  as  2174  to  7,54064. The  centrifugal  force  of  bodies  in  the  equator  is  to  the  centrifugal  force \nwith  which  bodies  recede  directly  from  the  earth  in  the  latitude  of  Parin \n48\u00b0  50'  10\"  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  radius  to  the  cosine  of  the \nlatitude,  that  is,  as  7,54064  to  3,267. Add  this  force  to  the  force  with \nwhich  bodies  descend  by  their  weight  in  the  latitude  of  Paris,  and  a  body, \nin  the  latitude  of  Paris,  falling  by  its  whole  undiminished  force  of  gravity, \nin  the  time  of  one  second,  will  describe  2177,267  lines,  or  15  Paris  feet, \n1  inch,  and  5,267  lines. And  the  total  force  of  gravity  in  that  latitude \nwill  be  to  the  centrifugal  force  of  bodies  in  the  equator  of  the  earth  as \n2177,267  to  7,54064,  or  as  289  to  1.", "force  of  bodies  in  the  equator  of  the  earth  as \n2177,267  to  7,54064,  or  as  289  to  1. Wherefore  if  APBQ,  represent  the  figure  of  the \nearth,  now  no  longer  spherical,  but  generated  by  the \nrotation  of  an  ellipsis  about  its  lesser  axis  PQ, ;  and \nACQqca  a  canal  full  of  water,  reaching  from  the  pole \nQq  to  the  centre  Cc,  and  thence  rising  to  the  equator \nArt  ;  the  weight  of  the  water  in  the  leg  of  the  canal \nACca  will  be  to  the  weight  of  water  in  the  other  leg \nQCcq  as  289  to  288,  because  the  centrifugal  force  arising  from  the  circu \nlar  motion  sustains  and  takes  off  one  of  the  289  parts  of  the  weight  (in  the \none  leg),  and  the  weight  of  288  in  the  other  sustains  the  rest. But  by \ncomputation  (from  Cor. 2,  Prop. XCI,  Book  I)  I  find,  that,  if  the  matter \nof  the  earth  was  all  uniform,  and  without  any  motion,  and  its  axis  PQ, \nwere  to  the  diameter  AB  as  100  to  101,  the  force  of  gravity  in  the \nplace  Q  towards  the  earth  would  be  to  the  force  of  gravity  in  the  same \nplace  Q  towards  a  sphere  described  about  the  centre  C  with  the  radius \nPC,  or  QC,  as  126  to  125. And,  by  the  same  argument,  the  force  of \ngravity  in  the  place  A  towards  the  spheroid  generated  by  the  rotation  of", "BOOK     III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 407 \nthe  ellipsis  APBQ,  about  the  axis  AI3  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  in  the \nsame  place  A,  towards  the  sphere  described  about  the  centre  C  with  the \nradius  AC,  as  125  to  126. But  the  force  of  gravity  in  the  place  A  to \nwards  the  earth  is  a  mean  proportional  betwixt  the  forces  of  gravity  to \nwards  the  spheroid  and  this  sphere;  because  the  sphere,  by  having  its  di \nameter  PQ,  diminished  in  the  proportion  of  101  to  100,  is  transformed  into \nthe  figure  of  the  earth ;  and  this  figure,  by  having  a  third  diameter  per \npendicular  to  the  two  diameters  AB  and  PQ,  diminished  in  the  same  pro \nportion,  is  converted  into  the  said  spheroid  ;  and  the  force  of  gravity  in  A, \nin  either  case,  is  diminished  nearly  in  the  same  proportion. Therefore  the \nforce  of  gravity  in  A  towards  the  sphere  described  about  the  centre  C  with \nthe  radius  AC,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  in  A  towards  the  earth  as  126  to \n1251.", "h \nthe  radius  AC,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  in  A  towards  the  earth  as  126  to \n1251. And  the  force  of  gravity  in  the  place  Q  towards  the  sphere  de \nscribed  about  the  centre  C  with  the  radius  QC,  is  to  the  force  of  gravity \nin  the  place  A  towards  the  sphere  described  about  the  centre  C,  with  the \nradius  AC,  in  the  proportion  of  the  diameters  (by  Prop. LXXII,  Book  I), \nthat  is,  as  100  to  101. If,  therefore,  we  compound  those  three  proportions \n126  to  125,  126  to  125|. and  100  to  101,  into  one,  the  force  of  gravity  in \nthe  place  Q  towards  the  earth  will  be  to  the  force  of  gravity  in  the  place \nA  towards  the  earth  as  126  X  126  X  100  to  125  X  125|  X  101 ;  or  as \n:>01  to  500. Now  since  (by  Cor. 3,  Prop.", "X  126  X  100  to  125  X  125|  X  101 ;  or  as \n:>01  to  500. Now  since  (by  Cor. 3,  Prop. XCI,  Book  I)  the  force  of  gravity  in  either \nleg  of  the  canal  ACca,  or  QCcy,  is  as  the  distance  of  the  places  from  the \ncentre  of  the  earth,  if  those  legs  are  conceived  to  be  divided  by  transverse., \nparallel,  and  equidistant  surfaces,  into  parts  proportional  to  the  wholes, \nthe  weights  of  any  number  of  parts  in  the  one  leg  ACca  will  be  to  the \nweights  of  the  same  number  of  parts  in  the  other  leg  as  their  magnitudes \nand  the  accelerative  forces  of  their  gravity  conjunctly,  that  is,  as  10 J  to \n100,  and  500  to  501. or  as  505  to  501. And  therefore  if  the  centrifugal \nforce  of  every  part  in  the  leg  ACca,  arising  from  the  diurnal  motion,  was \nto  the  weight  of  the  same  part  as  4  to  505,  so  that  from  the  weight  of \nevery  part,  conceived  to  be  divided  into  505  parts,  the  centrifugal  force \nmight  take  off  four  of  those  parts,  the  weights  would  remain  equal  in  each \nleg,  and  therefore  the  fluid  would  rest  in  an  equilibrium.", "would  remain  equal  in  each \nleg,  and  therefore  the  fluid  would  rest  in  an  equilibrium. But  the  centri \nfugal  force  of  every  part  is  to  the  weight  of  the  same  part  as  1  to  289  ; \nthat  is,  the  centrifugal  force,  which  should  be  T\u00a3y  parts  of  the  weight,  is \nonly  \u00a5|g  part  thereof. And,  therefore,  I  say,  by  the  rule  of  proportion, \nthat  if  the  centrifugal  force  j ^  make  the  height  of  the  water  in  the  leg \nACca  to  exceed  the  height  of  the  water  in  the  leg  QCcq  by  one  T|\u00a5  part \nof  its  whole  height,  the  centrifugal  force  -^jj  will  make  the  excess  of  the \nheight  in  the  leg  ACca  only  ^{^  part  of  the  height  of  the  water  in  the \nother  leg  QCcq  ;  and  therefore  the  diameter  of  the  earth  at  the  equator,  is \nto  its  diameter  from  pole  to  pole  as  230  to  229. And  since  the  mean  semi-", "108 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BooK  III. diameter  of  the  earth,  according  to  PicarVs  mensuration,  is  19615800 \nParis  feet,  or  3923,16  miles  (reckoning  5000  feet  to  a  mile),  the  earth \nwill  be  higher  at  the  equator  than  at  the  poles  by  85472  feet,  or  17^- \nmiles. And  its  height  at  the  equator  will  be  about  19658600  feet,  and  at \nthe  poles  19573000  feet. If,  the  density  and  periodic  time  of  the  diurnal  revolution  remaining  the \nsame,  the  planet  was  greater  or  less  than  the  earth,  the  proportion  of  the \ncentrifugal  force  to  that  of  gravity,  and  therefore  also  of  the  diameter  be \ntwixt  the  poles  to  the  diameter  at  the  equator,  would  likewise  remain  the \ngame. But  if  the  diurnal  motion  was  accelerated  or  retarded  in  any  pro \nportion,  the  centrifugal  force  would  be  augmented  or  diminished  nearly  in \nthe  same  duplicate  proportion ;  and  therefore  the  difference  of  the  diame \nters  will  be  increased  or  diminished  in  the  same  duplicate  ratio  very  nearly.", "he  diame \nters  will  be  increased  or  diminished  in  the  same  duplicate  ratio  very  nearly. And  if  the  density  of  the  planet  was  augmented  or  diminished  in  any  pro \nportion,  the  force  of  gravity  tending  towards  it  would  also  be  augmented \nor  diminished  in  the  same  proportion  :  and  the  difference  of  the  diameters \ncontrariwise  would  be  diminished  in  proportion  as  the  force  of  gravity  is \naugmented,  and  augmented  in  proportion  as  the  force  of  gravity  is  dimin \nished. Wherefore,  since  the  earth,  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  revolves  in \n23h. 56',  but  Jupiter  in  9h. 56',  and  the  squares  of  their  periodic  times  are \nas  29  to  5,  and  their  densities  as  400  to  94  \u00a3,  the  difference  of  the  diameters \n29      400        1 \nof  Jupiter  will  be  to  its  lesser  diameter  as  \u2014  X  ^^  X  ^Tm  to  1;  or  as  1  to \n9  f,  nearly. Therefore  the  diameter  of  Jupiter  from  east  to  west  is  to  its \ndiameter  from  pole  to  pole  nearly  as  10  \u00a3\u2022  to  9|-. Therefore  since  its \ngreatest  diameter  is  37\",  its  lesser  diameter  lying  between  the  poles  will \nbe  33\"  25\"'.", "reatest  diameter  is  37\",  its  lesser  diameter  lying  between  the  poles  will \nbe  33\"  25\"'. Add  thereto  about  3''  for  the  irregular  refraction  of  light, \nand  the  apparent  diameters  of  this  planet  will  become  40''  and  36\"  25\"' ; \nwhich  are  to  each  other  as  11  -j  to  10^,  very  nearly. These  things  are  so \nupon  the  supposition  that  the  body  of  Jupiter  is  uniformly  dense. But \nnow  if  its  body  be  denser  towards  the  plane  of  the  equator  than  towards \nthe  poles,  its  diameters  may  be  to  each  other  as  12  to  11,  or  13  to  12,  or \nperhaps  as  14  to  13. And  Cassini  observed  in  the  year  1691,  that  the  diameter  of  Jupiter \nreaching  from  east  to  west  is  greater  by  about  a  fifteenth  part  than  the \nother  diameter. Mr. Pound  with  his  123  feet  telescope,  and  an  excellent \nmicrometer,  measured  the  diameters  of  Jupiter  in  the  year  1719,  and  found \nthem  as  follow. The  Times. (jieatestdiam.

PROPOSITION  XX. PROBLEM  IV. To  find  and  compare  together  the  weights  of  bodies  in  the  different  re \ngions  of  our  earth. Because  the  weights  of  the  unequal  legs  of  the  canal \nof  water  ACQqca  are  equal  ;  and  the  weights  of  the \nparts  proportional  to  the  whole  legs,  and  alike  situated \nin  them,  are  one  to  another  as  the  weights  of  the  P| \nwholes,  and  therefore  equal  betwixt  themselves  ;  the \nweights  of  equal  parts,  and  alike  situated  in  the  legs, \nwill  be  reciprocally  as  the  legs,  that  is,  reciprocally  as \n230  to  229. And  the  case  is  the  same  in  all  homogeneous  equal  bodies  alike \nsituated  in  the  legs  of  the  canal.", "is  the  same  in  all  homogeneous  equal  bodies  alike \nsituated  in  the  legs  of  the  canal. Their  weights  are  reciprocally  as  the  legs, \nthat  is,  reciprocally  as  the  distances  of  the  bodies  from  the  centre  of  the  earth. Therefore  if  the  bodies  are  situated  in  the  uppermost  parts  of  the  canals,  or  on \nthe  surface  of  the  earth,  their  weights  will  be  one  to  another  reciprocally  as \ntheir  distances  from  the  centre. And. by  the  same  argument,  the  weights  in \nall  other  places  round  the  whole  surface  of  the  earth  are  reciprocally  as  the \ndistances  of  the  places  from  the  centre  ;  and,  therefore,  in  the  hypothesis \nof  the  earth's  being  a  spheroid  are  given  in  proportion. Whence  arises  this  Theorem,  that  the  increase  of  weight  in  passing  from \ntne  equator  to  the  poles  is  nearly  as  the  versed  sine  of  double  the  latitude  ; \nor,  which  comes  to  the  same  thinir,  as  the  square  of  the  right  sine  of  the \nlatitude  ;  and  the  arcs  of  the  degrees  of  latitude  in  the  meridian  increase \nnearly  in  the  same  proportion.", "rcs  of  the  degrees  of  latitude  in  the  meridian  increase \nnearly  in  the  same  proportion. And,  therefore,  since  the  latitude  of  Paris \nis  48\u00b0  50',  that  of  places  under  the  equator  00\u00b0  00',  and  that  of  places \nunder  the  poles  90\u00b0  ;  and  the  versed  sines  of  double  those  arcs  are \n11334,00000  and  20000,  the  radius  being  10000  ;  and  the  force  of  gravity \nat  the  pole  is  to  the  force  of  gravity  at  the  equator  as  230  to  229  ;  and \nthe  excess  of  the  force  of  gravity  at  the  pole  to  the  force  of  gravity  at  the \nequator  as  1  to  229  ;  the  excess  of  the  force  of  gravity  in  the  latitude  of \nParis  will  be  to  the  force  of  gravity  at  the  equator  as  1  X  Htll  to  229, \nor  as  5667  to  2290000. And  therefore  the  whole  forces  of  gravity  in \nthose  places  will  be  one  to  the  other  as  2295667  to  2290000.

Now  several  astronomers,  sent  into  remote  countries  to  make  astronomical \nobservations,  have  found  that  pendulum  clocks  do  accordingly  move  slower \nnear  the  equator  than  in  our  climates. And,  first  of  all,  in  the  year  I  72, \nM. Richer  took  notice  of  it  in  the  island  of  Cayenne ;  for  when,  in  the \nmonth  of  August,  he  was  observing  the  transits  of  the  fixed  stars  over  the \nmeridian,  he  found  his  clock  to  go  slower  than  it  ought  in  respect  of  the \nmean  motion  of  the  sun  at  the  rate  of  2'  29\"  a  day. Therefore,  fitting  up \na  simple  pendulum  to  vibrate  in  seconds,  which  were  measured  by  an  ex \ncellent  clock,  he  observed  the  length  of  that  simple  pendulum  ;  and  this  he \ndid  over  and  over  every  week  for  ten  months  together. And  upon  his  re \nturn  to  France,  comparing  the  length  of  that  pendulum  with  the  length", "iiJ.j  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 411 \nof  the  pendulum  at  Paris  (which  was  3  Paris  feet  and  8f  lines),  he  found \nit  shorter  by  1  j  line. Afterwards,  our  friend  Dr. Halley,  about  the  year  1677,  arriving  at  the \nisland  of  St. Helena,  found  his  pendulum  clock  to  go  slower  there  than  at \nIsondon  without  marking  the  difference. But  he  shortened  the  rod  of \nhis  clock  by  more  than  the  \\  of  an  inch,  or  l\u00a3  line  ;  and  to  effect  this,  be \ncause  the  length  of  the  screw  at  the  lower  end  of  the  rod  was  riot  sufficient, \nhe  interposed  a  wooden  ring  betwixt  the  nut  and  the  ball. Then,  in  the  year  1682,  M. Varin  and  M. des  Hayes  found  the  length \nof  a  simple  pendulum  vibrating  in  seconds  at  the  Royal  Observatory  of \nParis  to  be  3  feet  and  S|  lines. And  by  the  same  method  in  the  island \nof  Goree,  they  found  the  length  of  an  isochronal  pendulum  to  be  3  feet  and \n6 1  lines,  differing  from  the  former  by  two  lines. And  in  the  same  year, \ngoing  to  the  islands  of  Guadeloupe  and  Martinico,  they  found  that  the \nlength  of  an  isochronal  pendulum  in  those  islands  was  3  feet  and  6^  lines. After  this,  M.", "th  of  an  isochronal  pendulum  in  those  islands  was  3  feet  and  6^  lines. After  this,  M. Couplet,  the  son,  in  the  month  of  July  1697,  at  the  Royal \nObservatory  of  Paris,  so  fitted  his  pendulum  clock  to  the  mean  motion  of \nthe  sun,  that  for  a  considerable  time  together  the  clock  agreed  with  the \nmotion  of  the  sun. In  November  following,  upon  his  arrival  at  Lisbon,  he \nfound  his  clock  to  go  slower  than  before  at  the  rate  of  2'  13\"  in  24  hours. And  next  March  coming  to  Paraiba,  he  found  his  clock  to  go  slower  than \nat  Paris,  and  at  the  rate  4'  12\"  in  24  hours ;  and  he  affirms,  that  the  pen \ndulum  vibrating  in  seconds  was  shorter  at  Lisbon  by  2\u00b1  lines,  and  at  Pa \nraiba,  by  3 1  lines,  than  at  Paris. He  had  done  better  to  have  reckoned \nthose  differences  \\\\  and  2f :  for  these  differences  correspond  to  the  differ \nences  of  the  times  2'  13\"  and  4'  12\". But  this  gentleman's  observations \nare  so  gross,  that  we  cannot  confide  in  them. In  the  following  years,  1699,  and  1700,  M.", "so  gross,  that  we  cannot  confide  in  them. In  the  following  years,  1699,  and  1700,  M. des  Hayes,  making  another \nvoyage  to  America,  determined  that  in  the  island  of  Cayenne  and  Granada \nthe  length  of  the  pendulum  vibrating  in  seconds  was  a  small  matter  less \nthan  3  feet  and  6|  lines ;  that  in  the  island  of  St. Christophers  it  was \n3  feet  and  6f  lines ;  and  in  the  island  of  St. Domingo  3  feet  and  7 \nlines. And  in  the  year  1704,  P. Feuille,  at  Puerto  Bello  in  America,  found \nthat  the  length  of  the  pendulum  vibrating  in  seconds  was  3  Paris  feet, \nand  only  5--^  lines,  that  is,  almost  3  lines  shorter  than  at  Paris  ;  but  the \nobservation  was  faulty. For  afterward,  going  to  the  island  of  Martinico. he  found  the  length  of  the  isochronal  pendulum  there  3  Paris  feet  and \n5  \\  |  lines. Now  the  latitude  of  Paraiba  is  6\u00b0  38'  south ;  that  of  Puerto  Bello  9\u00b0 \n33'  north ;  and  the  latitudes  of  the  islands  Cayenne,  Goree,  Gaudaloupe} \nMartinico,  Granada,  St. Christophers,  and  St. Domingo,  are  respectively \n4C  55',  14\u00b0  40\",  15\u00b0  00',  14\u00b0  44',  12\u00b0  06',  17\u00b0  19',  and  19\u00b0  48',  north. An*J", "412  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nthe  excesses  of  the  length  of  the  pendulum  at  Paris  above  the  lengths  of \nthe  isochronal  pendulums  observed  in  those  latitudes  are  a  little  greater \nthan  by  the  table  of  the  lengths  of  the  pendulum  before  computed. And \ntherefore  the  earth  is  a  little  higher  under  the  equator  than  by  the  prece \nding  calculus,  and  a  little  denser  at  the  centre  than  in  mines  near  the  sur \nface,  unless,  perhaps,  the  heats  of  the  torrid  zone  have  a  little  extended  the \nlength  of  the  pendulums. For  M. Picart  has  observed,  that  a  rod  of  iron,  which  in  frosty  weather \nin  the  winter  season  was  one  foot  long,  when  heated  by  lire,  was  lengthened \ninto  one  foot  and  -]-  line. Afterward  M. de  la  Hire  found  that  a  rod  of \niron,  which  in  the  like  winter  season  was  6  feet  long,  when  exposed  to  the \nheat  of  the  summer  sun,  was  extended  into  6  feet  and  f  line. In  the  former \ncase  the  heat  was  greater  than  in  the  latter ;  but  in  the  latter  it  was  greater \nthan  the  heat  of  the  external  parts  of  a  human  body ;  for  metals  exposed \nto  the  summer  sun  acquire  a  very  considerable  degree  of  heat.", "ody ;  for  metals  exposed \nto  the  summer  sun  acquire  a  very  considerable  degree  of  heat. But  the  rod \nof  a  pendulum  clock  is  never  exposed  to  the  heat  of  the  summer  sun,  nor \never  acquires  a  heat  equal  to  that  of  the  external  parts  of  a  human  body ; \nand,  therefore,  though  the  3  feet  rod  of  a  pendulum  clock  will  indeed  be  a \nlittle  longer  in  the  summer  than  in  the  winter  season,  yet  the  difference  will \nscarcely  amount  to  \\  line. Therefore  the  total  difference  of  the  lengths  of \nisochronal  pendulums  in  different  climates  cannot  be  ascribed  to  the  differ \nence  of  heat ;  nor  indeed  to  the  mistakes  of  the  French  astronomers. For \nalthough  there  is  not  a  perfect  agreement  betwixt  their  observations,  yet \nthe  errors  are  so  small  that  they  may  be  neglected ;  and  in  this  they  all \nagree,  that  isochronal  pendulums  are  shorter  under  the  equator  than \nat  the  Royal  Observatory  of  Paris,  by  a  difference  not  less  than  1{  line, \nnor  greater  than  2|  lines. By  the  observations  of  M. Richer,  in  the  island \nof  Cayenne,  the  difference  was  1|  line. That  difference  being  corrected  by \nthose  of  M. des  Hayes,  becomes  \\\\  line  or  l\u00a3  line.", "That  difference  being  corrected  by \nthose  of  M. des  Hayes,  becomes  \\\\  line  or  l\u00a3  line. By  the  less  accurate \nobservations  of  others,  the  same  was  made  about  two  lines. And  this  dis \nagreement  might  arise  partly  from  the  errors  of  the  observations,  partly \nfrom  the  dissimilitude  of  the  internal  parts  of  the  earth,  and  the  height  of \nmountains ;  partly  from  the  different  heats  of  the  air. I  take  an  iron  rod  of  3  feet  long  to  be  shorter  by  a  sixth  part  of  one  line \nin  winter  time  with  us  here  in  England  than  in  the  summer. Because  of \nthe  great  heats  under  the  equator,  subduct  this  quantity  from  the  difference \nof  one  line  and  a  quarter  observed  by  M. Richer,  and  there  will  remain  one \nline  TV,  which  agrees  very  well  with  lT-o\u00a3o  ^ne  collected,  by  the  theory  a \nlittle  before. M. Richer  repeated  his  observations,  made  in  the  island  of \nCayenne,  every  week  for  ten  months  together,  and  compared  the  lengths  of \nthe  pendulum  which  he  had  there  noted  in  the  iron  rods  with  the  lengths \nthereof  which  he  observed  in  Prance. This  diligence  and  care  seems  to \nhave  been  wanting  to  the  other  observers.

PROPOSITION  XXI. THEOREM  XVII. That  the  equinoctial  points  go  backward,  and  that  the  axis  of  the  earth, \nby  a  nutation  in,  every  annual   revolution,  twice  vibrates  towards  the \necliptic,  and  as  often  returns  to  its  former  position,. The    proposition  appears   from   Cor. 20,   Prop. LXVI,  Book   I ;    but \nthat  motion   of  nutation  must  be  very  small,  and,  indeed,  scarcely  per \nceptible. PROPOSITION  XXII. THEOREM  XVIII. That  all  the  motions  of  the  ?noon,  and  all  the  inequalities  of  those  motions, \nfollow  from  the  principles  which  we  have  laid  down. That  the  greater  planets,  while  they  are  carried  about  the  sun,  may  in \nthe  mean  time  carry  other  lesser  planets,  revolving  about  them ;  and  that \nthose  lesser  planets  must  move  in  ellipses  which  have  their  foci  in  the  cen \ntres  of  the  greater,  appears  from  Prop. LXV,  Book  I. But  then  their  mo \ntions  will  be  several  ways  disturbed  by  the  action  of  the  sun,  and  they  will \nsuffer  such  inequalities  as  are  observed  in  our  moon. Thus  our  moon  (by \nCor.", "they  will \nsuffer  such  inequalities  as  are  observed  in  our  moon. Thus  our  moon  (by \nCor. 2,  3,  4,  and  5,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  moves  faster,  and,  by  a  radius \ndrawn  to  the  earth,  describes  an  area  greater  for  the  time,  and  has  its  orbit \nless  curved,  and  therefore  approaches  nearer  to  the  earth  in  the  syzygies \nthan  in  the  quadratures,  excepting  in  so  far  as  these  effects  are  hindered  by \nthe  motion  of  eccentricity  ;  for  (by  Cor. 9,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  the  eccen \ntricity  is  greatest  when  the  apogeon  of  the  moon  is  in  the  syzygies,  and \nleast  when  the  same  is  in  the  quadratures ;  and  upon  this  account  the  pe- \nrigeon  moon  is  swifter,  and  nearer  to  us,  but  the  apogeon  moon  slower, \narid  farther  from  us,  in  the  syzygies  than  in  the  quadratures. Moreover, \nthe  apogee  goes  forward,  and  the  nodes  backward  ;  and  this  is  done  not  with \na  regular  but  an  unequal  motion. For  (by  Cor. 7  and  8,  Prop. LXVI, \nBook  I)  the  apogee  goes  more  swiftly  forward  in  its  syzygies,  more  slowly \nbackward  in  its  quadratures;  and,  by  the  excess  of  its  progress  above  its \nregress,  advances  yearly  in  consequentia. But,  contrariwise,  the  nodes  (by \nCor. 11,  Prop.", "regress,  advances  yearly  in  consequentia. But,  contrariwise,  the  nodes  (by \nCor. 11,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  are  quiescent  in  their  syzygies,  and  go  fastest \nback  in  their  quadratures. Farther,  the  greatest  latitude  of  the  moon  (by \nCor. 10,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  is  greater  in  the  quadratures  of  the  moon \nthan  in  its  syzygies. And  (by  Cor. 6,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  the  mean  mo \ntion  of  the  moon  is  slower  in  the  perihelion  of  the  earth  than  in  its  aphelion.

For  the  veloc \nities  or  horary  motions  of  the  apogee  and  nodes  of  the  moon,  and  their \nequations,  as  well  as  the  difference  betwixt  the  greatest  eccentricity  in  the \nsyzygics,  and  the  least  eccentricity  in  the  quadratures,  and  that  inequality \nwhich  we  call  the  variation,  are  (by  Cor. 14,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  in  the \ncourse  of  the  year  augmented  and  diminished  in  the  triplicate  proportion \nof  the  sun's  apparent  diameter. And  besides  (by  Cor. 1  and  2,  Lem. 10, \nand  Cor. 16,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I)  the  variation  is  augmented  and \ndiminished  nearly  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  time  between \nthe  quadratures. But  in  astronomical  calculations,  this  inequality \nis  commonly  thrown  into  and  confounded  with  the  equation  of  the  moon's \ncentre. PROPOSITION  XXI1L     PROBLEM  V.

From  the  motions  of  our  moon  we  deduce  the  corresponding  motions  of \nthe  moons  or  satellites  of  Jupiter  in  this  manner,  by  Cor. 16,  Prop. LXVI, \nBook  I. The  mean  motion  of  the  nodes  of  the  outmost  satellite  of  Jupiter \nis  to  the  mean  motion  of  the  nodes  of  our  moon  in  a  proportion  compound \ned  of  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  periodic  times  of  the  earth  about  the \nsun  to  the  periodic  times  of  Jupiter  about  the  sun,  and  the  simple  propor \ntion  of  the  periodic  time  of  the  satellite  about  Jupiter  to  the  periodic  time \nof  our  moon  about  the  earth ;  and,  therefore,  those  nodes,  in  the  space  of \na  hundred  years,  are  carried  8\u00b0  24'  backward,  or  in  antecedentia.

PROPOSITION  XXIV. THEOREM  XIX. That  the  flax  and  reflux  of  the  sea  arise  from  the  actions  oj  the  sun \nand  moon. By  Cor. 19  and  20,  Prop. LXVI,  Book  I,  it  appears  that  the  waters  of \nthe  sea  ought  twice  to  rise  and  twice  to  fall  every  day. as  well  lunar  as  solar ; \nand  that  the  greatest  height  of  the  waters  in  the  open  and  deep  seas  ought \nto  follow  the  appulse  of  the  luminaries  to  the  meridian  of  the  place  by  a \nless  interval  than  6  hours  ;  as  happens  in  all  that  eastern  tract  of  the  Atlantic \nand  jEthinpic  seas  between  France  and  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope  ;  and  on \nthe  coasts  of  Chili  and  Pern,  in  the  Smith  Sea  ;  in  all  which  shores  the \nilo  >d  falls  out  about  the  second,  third,  or  fourth  hour,  unless  where  the \nmotion' propagated  from  the  deep  ocean  is  by  the  shallowness  of  the  chaiir \nnels,  through  which  it  passes  to  some  particular  places,  retarded  to  the \nfifth,  sixth,  or  seventh  hour,  and  even  later.", "some  particular  places,  retarded  to  the \nfifth,  sixth,  or  seventh  hour,  and  even  later. The  hours  I  reckon  from  the \nappulse  of  each  luminary  to  the  meridian  of  the  place,  as  well  under  as \nabove  the  horizon  ;  and  by  the  hours  of  the  lunar  day  I  understand  the \n24th  parts  uf  that  time  which  the  moon,  by  its  apparent  diurnal  motion, \nemploys  to  come  about  again  to  the  meridian  of  the  place  which  it  left  the \nday  before. The  force  of  the  sun  or  moon  in  raising  the  sea  is  greatest  in \nthe  appulse  of  the  luminary  to  the  meridian  of  the  place;  but  the  force \nimpressed  upon  the  sea  at  that  time  continues  a  little  while  after  the  im \npression,  and  is  afterwards  increased  by  a  new  though  less  force  still  act \ning  upon  it. This  makes  the  sea  rise  higher  and  higher,  till  this  new  force \nbecoming  too  weak  to  raise  it  any  more,  the  sea  rises  to  its  greatest  height. And  this  will  come  to  pass,  perhaps,  in  one  or  two  hours,  but  more  fre \nquently  near  the  shores  in  about  three  hours,  or  even  more,  where  the  sea \nis  shallow. The  two  luminaries  excite  two  motions,  wrhich  will  not  appear  distinctly, \nbut  between  them  will  arise  one  mixed  motion  compounded  out  of  both.", "appear  distinctly, \nbut  between  them  will  arise  one  mixed  motion  compounded  out  of  both. In  the  conjunction  or  opposition  of  the  luminaries  their  forces  will  be  con \njoined,  and  bring  on  the  greatest  flood  and  ebb. In  the  quadratures  the \nsun  will  raise  the  waters  which  the  moon  depresses,  and  depress  the  waters \nwhich  the  moon  raises,  and  from  the  difference  of  their  forces  the  smallest \nof  all  tides  will  follow. And  because  (as  experience  tells  us)  the  force  of \nthe  moon  is  greater  than  that  of  the  sun,  the  greatest  height  of  the  waters \nwill  happen  about  the  third  lunar  hour. Out  of  the  syzygies  and  quadra \ntures,  the  greatest  tide,  which  by  the  single  force  of  the  moon  oujjht  to  fall \nout  at  the  third  lunar  hour,  and  by  the  single  force  of  the  sun  at  the  third \nsolar  hour,  by  the  compounded  forces  of  both  must  fall  out  in  an  interme-", "416 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BOOK  in \ndiate  time  that  aproaches  nearer  to  the  third  hour  of  the  moon  than  tc \nthat  of  the  sun. And,  therefore,  while  the  moon  is  passing  from  the  syzy \ngies  to  the  quadratures,  during  which  time  the  3d  hour  of  the  sun  precedes \nthe  3d  hour  of  the  moon,  the  greatest  height  of  the  waters  will  also  precede \nthe  3d  hour  of  the  moon,  and  that,  by  the  greatest  interval,  a  little  after \nthe  octants  of  the  moon;  and,  by  like  intervals,  the  greatest  tide  will  fol \nlow  the  3d  lunar  hour,  while  the  moon  is  passing  from  the  quadratures  to \nthe  syzygies. Thus  it  happens  in  the  open  sea :  for  in  the  mouths  of \nrivers  the  greater  tides  come  liter  to  their  heiirht. o  O \nBut  the  effects  of  the  luminaries  depend  upon  their  distances  from  the \nearth  ;  for  when  they  are  less  distant,  their  effects  are  greater,  and  when \nmore  distant,  their  effects  are  less,  and  that  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of \ntheir  apparent  diameter.", "eir  effects  are  less,  and  that  in  the  triplicate  proportion  of \ntheir  apparent  diameter. Therefore  it  is  that  the  sun,  in  the  winter  time, \nbeing  then  in  its  perigee,  has  a  greater  effect,  and  makes  the  tides  in  the \nsyzygies  something  greater,  and  those  in  the  quadratures  something  less \nthan  in  the  summer  season ;  and  every  month  the  moon,  while  in  the  peri \ngee,  raises  greater  tides  than  at  the  distance  of  15  days  before  or  after, \nwhen  it  is  in  its  apogee. Whence  it  comes  to  pass  that  two  highest \ntides  do  not  follow  one  the  other  in  two  immediately  succeeding  syzygies. The  effect  of  either  luminary  doth  likewise  depend  upon  its  declination \nor  distance  from  the  equator  ;  for  if  the  luminary  was  placed  at  the  pole, \nit  would  constantly  attract  all  the  parts  of  the  waters  without  any  inten \nsion  or  remission  of  its  action,  and  could  cause  no  reciprocation  of  motion. And,  therefore,  as  the  luminaries  decline  from  the  equator  towards  either \npole,  they  will,  by  degrees,  lose  their  force,  and  on  this  account  will  excite \nlesser  tides  in  the  solstitial  than  in  the  equinoctial  syzygies.", "is  account  will  excite \nlesser  tides  in  the  solstitial  than  in  the  equinoctial  syzygies. But  in  the \nsolstitial  quadratures  they  will  raise  greater  tides  than  in  the  quadratures \nabout  the  equinoxes ;  because  the  force  of  the  moon,  then  situated  in  the \nequator,  most  exceeds  the  force  of  the  sun. Therefore  the  greatest  tides \nfall  out  in  those  syzygies,  and  the  least  in  those  quadratures,  which  hap- \npen  about  the  time  of  both  equinoxes  :  and  the  greatest  tide  in  the  syzy \ngies  is  always  succeeded  by  the  least  tide  in  the  quadratures,  as  we  find \nby  experience. But,  because  the  sun  is  less  distant  from  the  earth  in \nwinter  than  in  summer,  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  greatest  and  least  tides \nmore  frequently  appear  before  than  after  the  vernal  equinox,  and  more \nfrequently  after  than  before  the  autumnal. Moreover,  the  effects  of  the  lumi \nnaries  depend  upon  the  latitudes  of \nplaces.

Wherefore,  in  the  diurnal  revolution  of  any \nplace  F,  the  greatest  flood  will  be  in  F,  at  the  third  hour  after  the  appulse \nof  the  moon  to  the  meridian  above  the  horizon ;  and  afterwards  the  great \nest  ebb  in  Q,,  at  the  third  hour  after  the  setting  of  the  moon  ;  and  then \nthe  greatest  flood  in/,  at  the  third  hour  after  the  appulse  of  the  moon  to \nthe  meridian  under  the  horizon  ;  and,  lastly,  the  greatest  ebb  in  Q,,  at  the \nthird  hour  after  the  rising  of  the  moon  ;  and  the  latter  flood  in  /  will  be \nless  than  the  preceding  flood  in  F. For  the  whole  sea  is  divided  into  two \nhemispherical  floods,  one  in  the  hemisphere  KH/J  on  the  north  side,  the \nother  in  the  opposite  hemisphere  Khk,  which  we  may  therefore  call  the \nnorthern  and  the  southern  floods. These  floods,  being  always  opposite  the  one \nto  the  other,  come  by  turns  to  the  meridians  of  all  places,  after  an  interval \nof  12  lunar  hours.", ",  come  by  turns  to  the  meridians  of  all  places,  after  an  interval \nof  12  lunar  hours. And  seeing  the  northern  countries  partake  more  of \nthe  northern  flood,  and  the  southern  countries  more  of  the  southern  flood, \nthence  arise  tides,  alternately  greater  and  less  in  all  places  without  the \nequator,  in  which  the  luminaries  rise  and  set. But  the  greatest  tide  will \nhappen  when  the  moon  declines  towards  the  vertex  of  the  place,  about  the \nthird  hour  after  the  appulse  of  the  moon  to  the  meridian  above  the  hori \nzon  ;  and  when  the  moon  changes  its  declination  to  the  other  side  of  the \nequator,  that  which  was  the  greater  tide  will  be  changed  into  a  lesser. And  the  greatest  difference  of  the  floods  will  fall  out  about  the  times  of \nthe  solstices ;  especially  if  the  ascending  node  of  the  moon  is  about  the \nHrst  of  Aries. So  it  is  found  by  experience  that  the  morning  tides  in \nwinter  exceed  those  of  the  evening,  and  the  evening  tides  in  summer  ex \nceed  those  of  the  morning ;  at  Plymouth  by  the  height  of  one  foot,  but  at \nBristol  by  the  height  of  15  inches,  according  to  the  observations  of  Cole- \npress  and  Sturmy.", "by  the  height  of  15  inches,  according  to  the  observations  of  Cole- \npress  and  Sturmy. But  the  motions  which  we  have  been  describing  suffer  some  alteration \nfrom  that  force  of  reciprocation,  which  the  waters,  being  once  moved,  retain \na  little  while  by  their  vis  insita. Whence  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  tides \nmay  continue  for  some  time,  though  the  actions  of  the  luminaries  should \n27", "418  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \noease. This  power  of  retaining  the  impressed  motion  lessens  the  difference \nyf  the  alternate  tides,  and  makes  those  tides  which  immediately  succeed \nafter  the  syzygies  greater,  and  those  which  follow  next  after  the  quadra \ntures  less. And  hence  it  is  that  the  alternate  tides  at  Plymouth  and \nBristol  do  not  differ  much  more  one  from  the  other  than  by  the  height  of \na  foot  or  15  inches,  and  that  the  greatest  tides  of  all  at  those  ports  are  not \nthe  first  but  the  third  after  the  syzygies. And,  besides,  all  the  motions  are \nretarded  in  their  passage  through  shallow  channels,  so  that  the  greatest \ntides  of  all,  in  some  straits  and  mouths  of  rivers,  are  the  fourth  or  even  the \nfifth  after  the  syzygies. Farther,  it  may  happen  that  the  tide  may  be  propagated  from  the  ocean \nthrough  different  channels  towards  the  same  port,  and  may  pass  quicker \nthrough  some  channels  than  through  others ;  in  which  case  the  same  tide, \ndivided  into  two  or  more  succeeding  one  another,  may  compound  new  mo \ntions  of  different  kinds.", "into  two  or  more  succeeding  one  another,  may  compound  new  mo \ntions  of  different  kinds. Let  us  suppose  two  equal  tides  flowing  towards \nthe  same  port  from  different  places,  the  one  preceding  the  other  by  6  hours ; \nand  suppose  the  first  tide  to  happen  at  the  third  hour  of  the  appulse  of  the \nmoon  to  the  meridian  of  the  port. If  the  moon  at  the  time  of  the  appulse \nto  the  meridian  was  in  the  equator,  every  6  hours  alternately  there  would \narise  equal  floods,  which,  meeting  writh  as  many  equal  ebbs,  would  so  bal \nance  one  the  other,  that  for  that  day,  the  water  would  stagnate  and  remain \nquiet. If  the  moon  then  declined  from  the  equator,  the  tides  in  the  ocean \nwould  be  alternately  greater  and  less,  as  was  said ;  and  from  thence  two \ngreater  and  two  lesser  tides  wrould  be  alternately  propagated  towards  that \nport. But  the  two  greater  floods  would  make  the  greatest  height  of  the \nwaters  to  fall  out  in  the  middle  time  betwixt  both  ;  and  the  greater  and \nlesser  floods  would  make  the  waters  to  rise  to  a  mean  height  in  the  middle \ntime  between  them,  and  in  the  middle  time  between  the  two  lesser  floods  the \nwaters  would  rise  to  their  least  height.", "middle  time  between  the  two  lesser  floods  the \nwaters  would  rise  to  their  least  height.

In  that  port,  on  the  day  which  follows  after  the  passage \nof  the  moon  over  the  equator,  the  waters  stagnate:  when  the  moon  declines \nto  the  north,  they  begin  to  flow  and  ebb. not  twice,  as  in  other  ports,  but \nonce  only  every  day  :  and  the  flood  happens  at  the  setting,  and  the  greatest \nebb  at  the  rising  of  the  moon.

Take  this  ratio  twice  inversely,  and  the  former  ratio  once  di \nrectly,  and  the  curvature  of  the  orb  of  the  moon  in  the  syzygies  will  be  to \nthe  curvature  thereof  in  the  quadratures  as  120406729  X  17S725AT2  X \nCT2  X  N\u2014  120406729  X  2000AT4  X  CT  to  122611329  X  178725  AT2 \nX  CT2  X  N  +  122611329  X  1000CT4  X  AT,  that  is,  as  2151969AT \nX  CT  X  N  \u2014  24081AT3  to  2191371AT  X  CT  X  N  +  12261CT3. Because  the  figure  of  the  moon's  orbit  is  unknown,  let  us,  in  its  stead, \nassume  the  ellipsis  DBCA,  in  the  centre  of  which  we  suppose  the  earth  to \nbe  situated,  and  the  greater  axis  DC  to  lie  between  the  quadratures  as  the \nlesser  AB  between  the  syzygies. But  since  the  plane  of  this  ellipsis  is  re- \nrolved  about  the  earth  by  an  angular  motion,  and  the  orbit,  whose  curva \nture  we  now  examine,  should  be  described  in  a  plane  void  of  such  motion", "424 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BOOK  III \nwe  are  to  consider  the  figure  which  the  moon, \nwhile  it  is  revolved  in  that  ellipsis,  describes  iu \nthis  plane,  that  is  to  say,  the  figure  Cpa,  the \nseveral  points  p  of  which  are  found  by  assuming \nany  point  P  in  the  ellipsis,  which  may  represent \nthe  place  of  the  moon,  and  drawing  Tp  equal \nto  TP  in  such  manner  that  the  angle  PT/? may \nbe  equal  to  the  apparent  motion  of  the  sun  from \nthe  time  of  the  last  quadrature  in  C  ;  or  (which \ncomes  to  the  same  thing)  that  the  angle  CTp \nmay  be  to  the  angle  CTP  as  the  time  of  the \nsynodic  revolution  of  the  moon  to  the  time  ot \nthe  periodic  revolution  thereof,  or  as  29'1. 12h. 44'  to  27d. 7'1. 43'.

Therefore,  in  order  to  find  th\u00ab", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. \u2022  425 \nproportion  of  CT  to  AT,  let  us  multiply  the  extremes  and  the  means,  an(? the  terms  which  come  out,  applied  to  AT  X  CT,  become  2062,79CT4  \u2014 \n2151969N  x  CT3  +  368676N  X  AT  X  CT2  +  36342  AT2  X  CT2  - \n362047N  X  AT2  X  CT  +  2191371N  X  AT3  +  4051,4AT4  =  0.

And \nsubstituting  those  values  in  the  equation,  after  resolving  thereof,  wre  shall \nfind  x  =  0,00719 ;  and  from  thence  the  semi-diameter  CT  =  1,00719,  and \nthe  semi-diameter  AT  =  0,99281,  which  numbers  are  nearly  as  70^,  and \n692V-  Therefore  the  moon's  distance  from  the  earth  in  the  syzygies  is  to \nits  distance  in  the  quadratures  (setting  aside  the  consideration  of  eccentrici \nty)  as  09  2^  to  70^ ;  or,  in  round  numbers,  as  69  to  70. PROPOSITION  XXIX. PROBLEM  X. To  find  the  variation  of  the  moon. This  inequality  is  owing  partly  to  the  elliptic  figure  of  the  moon's  orbit, \npartly  to  the  inequality  of  the  moments  of  the  area  which  the  moon  by  a \nradius  drawn  t\\)  the  earth  describes.", "of  the  moments  of  the  area  which  the  moon  by  a \nradius  drawn  t\\)  the  earth  describes. If  the  moon  P  revolved  in  the  ellipsis \nDBCA  about  the  earth  quiescent  in  the  centre  of  the  ellipsis,  and  by  the \nradius  TP,  drawn  to  the  earth,  described  the  area  CTP,  proportional  to \nthe  time  of  description  ;  and  the  greatest  semi-diameter  CT  of  the  ellipsis \nwas  to  the  least  TA  as  70  to  69;  the  tangent  of  the  angle  CTP  would  be \nto  the  tangent  of  the  angle  of  the  mean  motion,  computed  from  the  quad \nrature  C,  as  the  semi-diameter  TA  of  the  ellipsis  to  its  semi-diameter  TC, \nor  as  69  to  70.", "C,  as  the  semi-diameter  TA  of  the  ellipsis  to  its  semi-diameter  TC, \nor  as  69  to  70. But  the  description  of  the  area  CTP,  as  the  moon  advan \nces  from  the  quadrature  to  the  syzygy,  ought  to  be  in  such  manner  accel \nerated,  that  the  moment  of  the  area  in  the  moon's  syzygy  may  be  to  the \nmoment  thereof  in  its  quadrature  as  11073  to  10973;  and  that  the  excess \nof  the  moment  in  any  intermediate  place  P  above  the  moment  in  the  quad \nrature  may  be  as  the  square  of  the  sine  of  the  angle  CTP  ;  which  we  may \neffect  with  accuracy  enough,  if  we  diminish  the  tangent  of  the  angle  CTP \nin  the  subduplicate  proportion  of  the  number  10973  to  the  number  11073, \nthat  is,  in  proportion  of  the  number  68,6877  to  the  number  69. Upon \nwhich  account  the  tangent  of  the  angle  CTP  will  now  be  to  the  tangent \nof  the  mean  motion  as  68,6877  to  70 ;  and  the  angle  CTP  in  the  octants, \nwhere  the  mean  motion  is  45\u00b0,  will  be  found  44\u00b0  27'  28\",  which  sub \ntracted  from  45\u00b0,  the  angle  of  the  mean  motion,  leaves  the  greatest  varia \ntion  32'  32\". Thus  it  would  be,  if  the  moon,  in  passing  from  the  quad \nrature  to  the  syzygy,  described  an  angle  CTA  of  90  degrees  only.", "assing  from  the  quad \nrature  to  the  syzygy,  described  an  angle  CTA  of  90  degrees  only. But \nbecause  of  the  motion  of  the  earth,  by  which  the  sun  is  apparently  trans \nferred  in  consequentia^  the  moon,  before  it  overtakes  the  sun,  describes  an \nangle  CTtf,  greater  than  a  right  angle,  in  the  proportion  of  the  time  of  the \nsynodic  revolution  of  the  moon  to  the  time  of  its  periodic  revolution,  thai", "126 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES \n[BOOK  III \nis,  in  the  proportion  of  29'1. 12h. 44'  to  27(l. 7X  43'. Whence  it  comes  tc \npass  that  all  the  angles  about  the  centre  T  are  dilated  in  the  same  pro \nportion  ;  and  the  greatest  variation,  which  otherwise  would  be  but  32' \n32\",  now  augmented  in  the  said  proportion,  becomes  35'  10\". And  this  is  its  magnitude  in  the  mean  distance  of  the  sun  from  the \nearth,  neglecting  the  differences  which  may  arise  from  the  curvature  of \nthe  orbis  magnns,  and  the  stronger  action  of  the  sun  upon  the  moon  when \nhorned  and  new,  than  when  gibbous  and  full. In  other  distances  of  the \nsun  from  the  earth,  the  greatest  variation  is  in  a  proportion  compounded \nof  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  time  of  the  synodic  revolution  of  the \nmoon  (the  time  of  the  year  being  given)  directly,  and  the  triplicate  pro \nportion  of  the  distance  of  the  sun  from  the  earth  inversely.

Hitherto  we  have  investigated  the  variation  in  an  orb  not  eccentric,  in \nwhich,  to  wit,  the  moon  in  its  octants  is  always  in  its  mean  distance  from \nthe  earth. If  the  moon,  on  account  of  its  eccentricity,  is  more  or  less  re \nmoved  from  the  earth  than  if  placed  in  this  orb,  the  variation  may  be \nsomething  greater,  or  something  less,  than  according  to  this  rule. But  I \nleave  the  excess  or  defect  to  the  determination  of  astronomers  from  the \nphenomena. PROPOSITION  XXX. PROBLEM  XI. To  find  the  horary  motion  of  the  nodes  of  ihe  moon  in  a  circular  orbit. Let  S  represent  the  sun,  T  the  earth,  P  the  moon,  NP/A  the  orbit,  of  thr \nmoon,  Njo/? the  orthographic  projection  of  the  orbit  upon  the  plane  of  th' \necliptic :  N. n  the  nodes. nTNm  the  line  of  the  nodes  produced  indeti  \u2022", "BOOK  III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 427 \nnitely ;  PI,  PK  perpendiculars  upon  the  lines  ST,  Qq ;  Pp  a  perpendicu \nlar  upon  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic;  A,  B  the  moon's  syzygies  in  the  plane \nof  the  ecliptic;  AZ  a  perpendicular  let  fall  upon  Nil,  the  line  of  the \nnodes ;  Q,  g  the  quadratures  of  the  moon  in  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic,  and \npK  a  perpendicular  on  the  line  Qq  lying  between  the  quadratures. The \nforce  of  the  sun  to  disturb  the  motion  of  the  moon  (by  Prop. XXV)  is \ntwofold,  one  proportional  to  the  line  LM,  the  otlier  to  the  line  MT,  in  the \nscheme  of  that  Proposition  ;  and  the  moon  by  the  former  force  is  drawn \ntowards  the  earth,  by  the  latter  towards  the  sun,  in  a  direction  parallel  to \nthe  right  line  ST  joining  the  earth  and  the  sun. The  former  force  LM \nacts  in  the  direction  of  the  plane  of  the  moon's  orbit,  and  therefore  makes \nno  change  upon  the  situation  thereof,  and  is  upon  that  account  to  be  neg \nlected  ;  the  latter  force  MT,  by  which  the  plane  of  the  moon's  orbit  is  dis \nturbed,  is  the  same  with  the  force  3PK  or  SIT. And  this  force  (by  Prop.", "orbit  is  dis \nturbed,  is  the  same  with  the  force  3PK  or  SIT. And  this  force  (by  Prop. XXV)  is  to  the  force  by  which  the  moon  may,  in  its  periodic  time,  be  uni \nformly  revolved  in  a  circle  about  the  earth  at  rest,  as  SIT  to  the  radius  of \nthe  circle  multiplied  by  the  number  178,725,  or  as  IT  to  the  radius  there \nof  multiplied  by  59,575. But  in  this  calculus,  and  all  that  follows. I \nconsider  all  the  lines  drawn  frorri  the  moon  to  the  sun  as  parallel  to  the \nline  which  joins  the  earth  and  the  sun ;  because  what  inclination  there  is \nalmost  as  much  diminishes  all  effects  in  some  cases  as  it  augments  them \nin  others  :  and  we  are  now  inquiring  after  the  mean  motions  of  the  nodes, \nneglecting  such  niceties  as  are  of  no  moment,  and  would  only  serve  to  ren \nder  the  calculus  more  perplexed. Now  suppose  PM  to  represent  an  arc  which  the  moon  describes  in  the \nleast  moment  of  time,  and  ML  a  little  line,  the  half  of  which  the  moon, \nby  the  impulse  of  the  said  force  SIT,  would  describe  in  the  same  time ;  and \njoining  PL,  MP,  let  them  be  produced  to  m  and  /,  where  they  cut  the  plane \nof  the  ecliptic,  and  upon  Tm  let  fall  the  perpendicular  PH.", "where  they  cut  the  plane \nof  the  ecliptic,  and  upon  Tm  let  fall  the  perpendicular  PH. Now,  since \nthe  right  line  ML  is  parallel  to  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic,  and  therefore  can \nnever  meet  with  the  right  line  ml  which  lies  in  that  plane,  and  yet  both \nthose  right  lines  lie  in  one  common  plane  LMPm/,  they  will  be  parallel, \nand  upon  that  account  the  triangles  LMP,  ImP  will  be  similar. And \nseeing  MPra  lies  in  the  plane  of  the  orbit,  in  which  the  moon  did  move \nwhile  in  the  place  P,  the  point  m  will  fall  upon  the  line  N//,  which  passes \nthrough  the  nodes  N,  n,  of  that  orbit. And  because  the  force  by  which  the \nhalf  of  the  little  line  LM  is  generated,  if  the  whole  had  been  together,  and \nit  once  impressed  in  the  point  P,  would  hav^  generated  that  whole  line, \nand  caused  the  moon  to  move  in  the  arc  whoso  chord  is  LP  ;  t  at  is  to  say, \nwould  have  transferred  the  moon  from  the  plane  MPwT  into  the  plane \nLP/T;  therefore  th*  angular  motion  of  the  nodes  generated  by  that  force \nwill  be  equal  to  the  angle  mTL  But  n.l  is  to  raP  as  ML  to  MP ;  and \nsince  ML3,  because  of  the  time  given,  is  also  given,  ml  will  be  as  the  rectan-", "428  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III. gle  ML  X  mP,  that  is,  as  the  rectangle  IT  X  mP. And  if  Tml  is  a  right \nano-le,  the  angle  mTl  will  be  as  7^\u2014'  and  therefore  as  \u2014 ^\u2014    \u2014  that  is  (be- \nTm  Tm \nITxPH* \ncause  Tm  and  mP,  TP  and  PH  are  proportional),  as \u2014 FFp~ '  and,  there \nfore,  because  TP  is  given,  as  IT  X  PH. But  if  the  angle  Tml  or  STN \nis  oblique,  the  angle  mTl  will  be  yet  less,  in  proportion  of  the  sine  of  the \nangle  STN  to  the  radius,  or  AZ  to  AT. And  therefore  the  velocity  of \nthe  nodes  is  as  IT  X  PH  X  AZ,  or  as  the  solid  content  of  the  sines  of  the \nthree  angles  TPI,  PTN,  and  STN. If  these  are  right  angles,  as  happens  when  the  nodes  are  in  the  quadra \ntures,  and  the  moon  in  the  syzygy,  the  little  line  ml  will  be  removed  to \nan  infinite  distance,  and  the  angle  mTl  will  become  equal  to  the  angle \nmPl. But  in  this  case  the  angle  mPl  is  to  the  angle  PTM,  which  the \nmoon  in  the  same  time  by  its  apparent  motion  describes  about  the  earth, \nas  1  to  59,575.", "n  in  the  same  time  by  its  apparent  motion  describes  about  the  earth, \nas  1  to  59,575. For  the  angle  mPl  is  equal  to  the  angle  LPM,  that  is,  to \nthe  angle  of  the  moon's  deflexion  from  a  rectilinear  path;  which  angle,  if \nthe  gravity  of  the  moon  should  have  then  ceased,  the  said  force  of  the  sun \nSIT  would  by  itself  have  generated  in  that  given  time :  and  the  angle \nPTM  is  equal  to  the  angle  of  the  moon's  deflexion  from  a  rectilinear  path; \nwhich  angle,  if  the  force  of  the  sun  31T  should  have  then  ceased,  the  force \nalone  by  which  the  moon  is  retained  in  its  orbit  would  have  generated  in \nthe  same  time. And. these  forces  (as  we  have  above  shewn)  are  the  one  to \nthe  other  as  I  to  59,575. Since,  therefore,  the  mean  horary  motion  of  the \nmoon  (in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars)  is  32'  56\"  27'\"  12^-iv. the  horary  motion \nof  the  node  in  this  case  will  be  33\"  10\"'  331V. 12V. But  in  other  cases  the \nhorary  motion  will  be  to  33\"  10'\"  33iv. \\2\\  as  the  solid  content  of  the  sines \nof  the  three  angles  TPI,  PTN,  and  STN  (or  of  the  distances  of  the  moon \nfrom  the  quadrature,  of  the  moon  from  the  node,  and  of  the  node  from  the \nsun)  to  the  cube  of  the  radius.", "f  the  moon  from  the  node,  and  of  the  node  from  the \nsun)  to  the  cube  of  the  radius. And  as  often  as  the  sine  of  any  angle  is \nchanged  from  positive  to  negative,  and  from  negative  to  positive,  so  often \nmust  the  regressive  be  changed  into  a  progressive,  and  the  progressive  into \na  regressive  motion. Whence  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  nodes  are  pro \ngressive  as  often  as  the  moon  happens  to  be  placed  between  either  quadra \nture,  and  the  node  nearest  to  that  quadrature. In  other  cases  they  are \nregressive,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  regress  above  the  progress,  they  are \nmonthly  transferred  in  antecedentia. COR. 1.

But  the  moon,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  earth,  describes  the  area  in  the \nsyzygie-s  with  a  greater  velocity  than  it  does  that  in  the  quadratures,  and \nupon  that  account  the  time  is  contracted  in  the  syzygies,  and  prolonged  in \nthe  quadratures ;  and  together  with  the  time  the  motion  of  the  nodes  is \nlikewise  augmented  or  diminished. But  the  moment  of  the  area  in  the \nquadrature  of  the  moon  was  to  the  moment  thereof  in  the  syzygies  as \n10973  to  11073  ;  and  therefore  the  mean  moment  in  the  octants  is  to  the \nexcess  in  the  syzygies. and  to  the  defect  in  the  quadratures,  as  1 1023,  the \nhalf  sum  of  those  numbers,  to  their  half  difference1  50.", "e  quadratures,  as  1 1023,  the \nhalf  sum  of  those  numbers,  to  their  half  difference1  50. Wherefore  since \nthe  time  of  the  moon  in  the  several  little  equal  parts  of  its  orbit  is  recip \nrocally  as  its  velocity,  the  mean  time  in  the  -octants  will  be  to  the  excess \nof  the  time  in  the  quadratures,  and  to  the  defect  of  the  lime  in  the  syzy \ngies  arising  from  this  cause,  nearly  as  11023  to  50. But,  reckoning  from \nthe  quadratures  to  the  syzygies,  I  find  that  the  excess  of  the  moments  of \nthe  area,  in  the  several  places  above  the  least  moment  in  the  quadratures, \nis  nearly  as  the  square  of  the  sine  of  the  moon's  distance  from  the  quad \nratures  :  and  therefore  the  difference  betwixt  the  moment  in  any  place, \nand  the  mean  moment  in  the  octants,  is  as  the  difference  betwixt  the  square \nof  the  sine  of  the  moon's  distance  from  the  quadratures,  and  the  square \nof  the  sine  of  45  degrees,  or  half  the  square  of  the  radius ;  and  the  in \ncrement  of  the  time  in  the  several  places  between  the  octants  and  quad \nratures,  and  the  decrement  thereof  between  the  octants  and  syzygies,  is  in \nthe  same  proportion.", "and  the  decrement  thereof  between  the  octants  and  syzygies,  is  in \nthe  same  proportion.

Wherefore  the  motion  of  the  nodes  in  the  syzy- \ngj-es,  in  the  time  while  the  moon  describes  given  little  parts  of  its  orbit, \nis  diminished  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  number  H07.'J  to  the  num \nber  11023:  and  the  decrement  is  to  the  remaining  motion  as  100  to \n10973  ;  but  to  the  whole  motion  as  100  to  11073  nearly. But  the  decre \nment  in  the  places  between  the  octants  and  syzygies,  and  the  increment  in \nthe  places  between  the  octants  and  quadratures,  is  to  this  decrement  nearly \nas  the  whole  motion  in  these  places  to  the  whole  motion  in  the  syzygies, \nand  the  difference  betwixt  the  square  of  the  sine  of  the  moon's  distance \nfrom  the  quadrature,  and  the  half  square  of  the  radius,  to  the  half  square \nof  the  radius  conjunctly.", "ture,  and  the  half  square  of  the  radius,  to  the  half  square \nof  the  radius  conjunctly.

OF  THE  MOTION  OF  THE  MOON'S  NODES. <  PROPOSITION  I. 1  The  mean  motion  of  the  sir/i  from  the  node  is  defined  by  a  geometric \nmean  proportional  between  the  mean  motion  of  the  sun  and  that  mean \nmotion,  with  which  the  sun  recedes  with  the  greatest  swiftness  from  the \nnode  in  the  quadratures. \"  Let  T  be  the  earth's  place,  Nn  the  line  of  the  moon's  nodes  at  any \naiven  time,  KTM  a  perpendicular  thereto,  TA  a  right  line  revolving \nabout  the  centre  with  the  same  angular  velocity  with  which  the  sun  and \nthe  node  recede  from  one  another,  in  such  sort  that  the  angle  between  the \nquiescent  right  line  Nra  and  the  revolving  line  TA  may  be  always  equal \nto  the  distance  of  the  places  of  the  sun  and  node. Now  if  any  right  line \nTK  be  divided  into  parts  TS  and  SK,  and  thost  parts  be  taken  as  the \nmean  horary  motion  of  the  sun  to  the  mean  horary  motion  of  the  node  in \nthe  quadratures,  and  there  be  taken  the  right  line  TH,  a  mean  propor \ntional  between  the  part  TS  and  the  whole  TK,  this  right  line  will  be  pro \nportional  to  the  sun's  mean  motion  from  the  node.", "le  TK,  this  right  line  will  be  pro \nportional  to  the  sun's  mean  motion  from  the  node. \"  For  let  there  be  described  the  circle  NKnM  from  the  centre  T  and \nwith  the  radius  TK,  and  about  the  same  centre,  with  the  semi-axis  TH", "438 \nTHE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nN \nand  TNr  let  there  be  described  an  ellipsis  NHwL ;  and  in  the  time  in \nwhich  the  sun  recedes  from  the  node  through  the  arc  N0,  if  there  be  drawn \nthe  right  line  Tba,  the  area  of  the  sector  NTa  will  be  the  exponent  of  the \nsum  of  the  motions  of  the  sun  and  node  in  the  same  time. Let,  there \nfore,  the  extremely  small  arc  aA. be  that  which  the  right  line  T/w,  revolv \ning  according  to  the  aforesaid  law,  will  uniformly  describe  in  a  given \nparticle  of  time,  and  the  extremely  small  sector  TAa  will  be  as  the  sum \nof  the  velocities  with  which  the  sun  and  node  are  carried  two  different \nways  in  that  time.

The  other  part  of  this  sum,  namely,  the  mean \nquantity  of  the  velocity  of  the  node,  is  increased  in  the  recess  from  the \ngyzygies  in  a  duplicate  ratio  of  the  sine  of  its  distance  from  the  sun  (by \nCor. Prop.

But  the  ellipsis  NBH  divides  the  sector  AT\u00ab,  the  expo \nnent  of  the  sum  of  these  two  velocities,  into  two  parts  ABba  and  BTb, \nproportional  to  the  velocities. For  produce  BT  to  the  circle  in  0,  and \nfrom  the  point  B  let  fall  upon  the  greater  axis  the  perpendicular  BG, \nwhich  being  produced  both  ways  may  meet  the  circle  in  the  points  F  and \nf;  and  because  the  space  ABba  is  to  the  sector  TBb  as  the  rectangle  AB\u00a3 \nto  BT2  (that  rectangle  being  equal  to  the  difference  of  the  squares  of  TA \nnnd  TB,  because  the  right  line  A3  is  equally  cut  in  T,  and  unequally  in \nB),  therefore  when  the  space  ABba  is  the  greatest  of  all  in  K,  this  ratio \nwill  be  the  same  as  the  ratio  of  the  rectangle  KHM  to  HT2.

And  because \nthe  rectangle  KHM  is  to  HT2  as  FB/  to  BG2,  and  the  rectangle  AB(3  is \nequal  to  the  rectangle  FB/,  therefore  the  little  area  ABba,  where  it  is \ngreatest,  is  to  the  remaining  sector  TB6  as  the  rectangle  AB/3  to  BG2 \nBut  the  ratio  of  these  little  areas  always  was  as  the  rectangle  AB#  to \nBT2  ;  and  therefore  the  little  area  ABba  in  the  place  A  is  less  than  its \ncorrespondent  little  area  in  the  quadratures  in  the  duplicate  ratio  cf  BG \nto  BT,  that  is,  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  sine  of  the  sun's  distance \nfrom  the  node. And  therefore  the  sum  of  all  the  little  areas  ABba,  to \nwit,  the  space  ABN,  will  be  as  the  motion  of  the  node  in  the  time  in \nwhich  the  sun  hath  been  going  over  the  arc  NA  since  he  left  the  node; \nand  the  remaining  space,  namely,  the  elliptic  sector  NTB,  will  be  as  die \nsun's  mean  motion  in  the  same  time.", "namely,  the  elliptic  sector  NTB,  will  be  as  die \nsun's  mean  motion  in  the  same  time.

In  other  situations  of  the  moon,  this  men \nstrual  inequality,  to  which  the  variation  of  the  inclination  is  obnoxious  in \nthe  calculus  of  the  moon's  latitude,  is  balanced,  and  in  a  manner  took  off, \nby  the  menstrual  inequality  of  the  motion  of  the  nodes  (as  we  said \nbefore),  and  therefore  may  be  neglected  in  the  computation  of  the  said \nlatitude.

By  the  same  theory  I  moreover  found  that  the  an \nnual  equation  of  the  mean  motion  of  the  moon  arises  from  the  various", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY  445 \ndilatation  which  the  orbit  of  the  moon  suffers  from  the  action  of  the  sun \naccording  to  Cor. 6,  Prop. LXVI. Book  I. The  force  of  this  action  is \ngreater  in  the  perigeon  sun,  and  dilates  the  moon's  orbit ;  in  the  apogeon \nsun  it  is  less,  and  permits  the  orbit  to  be  again  contracted. The  moon \nmoves  slower  in  the  dilated  and  faster  in  the  contracted  orbit  ;  and  the \nannual  equation,  by  which  this  inequality  is  regulated,  vanishes  in  the \napogee  and  perigee  of  the  sun. In  the  mean  distance  of  the  sun  from  the \nearth  it  arises  to  about  11'  50\"  ;  in  other  distances  of  the  sun  it  is  pro \nportional  to  the  equation  of  the  sun's  centre,  and  is  added  to  the  mean \nmotion  of  the  moon,  while  the  earth  is  passing  .from  its  aphelion  to  its \nperihelion,  and  subducted  while  the  earth  is  in  the  opposite  semi-circle.

But  the  eccentricity  of  the  earth  seems  to \nbe  something  greater,  and  with  the  eccentricity  this  equation  will  be  aug \nmented  in  the  same  proportion.", "er,  and  with  the  eccentricity  this  equation  will  be  aug \nmented  in  the  same  proportion. Suppose  the  eccentricity  16}^,  and  the \ngreatest  equation  will  be  11'  51\". Farther ;  I  found  that  the  apogee  and  nodes  of  the  moon  move  fastei \nin  the  perihelion  of  the  earth,  where  the  force  of  the  sun's  action  is  greater, \nthan  in  the  aphelion  thereof,  and  that  in  the  reciprocal  triplicate  propor \ntion  of  the  earth's  distance  from  the  sun  ;  and  hence  arise  annual  equa \ntions  of  those  motions  proportional  to  the  equation  of  the  sun's  centre. Now  the  motion  of  the  sun  is  in  the  reciprocal  duplicate  proportion  of  the \nearth's  distance  from  the  sun  ;  and  the-  greatest  equation  of  the  centre \nwhich  this  inequality  generates  is  1\u00b0  56'  20\",  corresponding  to  the  above- \nmentioned  eccentricity  of  the  sun,  16}\u00a3.", "es  is  1\u00b0  56'  20\",  corresponding  to  the  above- \nmentioned  eccentricity  of  the  sun,  16}\u00a3. But  if  the  motion  of  the  sun \nhad  been  in  the  reciprocal  triplicate  proportion  of  the  distance,  this  ine \nquality  would  have  generated  the  greatest  equation  2\u00b0  54'  30\"  ;  and  there \nfore  the  greatest  equations  which  the  inequalities  of  the  motions  of  the \nmoon's  apogee  and  nodes  do  generate  are  to  2\u00b0  54'  30\"  as  the  mean  diur \nnal  motion  of  the  moon's  apogee  and  the  mean  diurnal  motion  of  its \nnodes  are  to  the  mean  diurnal  motion  of  the  sun.

The  former \nequation  is  added,  and  the  latter  subducted,  while  the  earth  is  passing \nfrom  its  perihelion  to  its  aphelion,  and  contrariwise  when  the  earth  is  in \nthe  opposite  semi-circle.", "helion  to  its  aphelion,  and  contrariwise  when  the  earth  is  in \nthe  opposite  semi-circle.

And  hence  arises  another  equation  of  the  moon's  moan  motion,  depending", "446  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nupon  the  situation  of  the  moon's  apogee  in  respect  of  the  sun,  which  is  in \nits  greatest  quantity  when  the  moon's  apogee  is  in  the  octants  of  the  sun, \nand  vanishes  when  the  apogee  arrives  at  the  quadratures  or  syzygies  ;  and \nit  is  added  to  the  mean  motion  while  the  moon's  apogee  is  passing  from \nthe  quadrature  of  the  sun  to  the  syzygy,  and  subducted  while  the  apogee \nis  passing  from  the  syzygy  to  the  quadrature. This  equation,  which  I \nshall  call  the  semi-annual,  when  greatest  in  the  octants  of  the  apogee, \narises  to  about  3'  45\",  so  far  as  I  could  collect  from  the  phenomena  :  and \nthis  is  its  quantity  in  the  mean  distance  of  the  sun  from  the  earth.

By  the  same  theory  of  gravity,  the  action  of  the  sun  upon  the  moon  is \nsomething  greater  when  the  line  of  the  moon's  nodes  passes  through  the \nsun  than  when  it  is  at  right  angles  with  the  line  which  joins  the  sun  and \nthe  earth  ;  and  hence  arises  another  equation  of  the  moon's  mean  motion, \nwhich  I  shall  call  the  second  semi-annual ;  and  this  is  greatest  when  the \nnodes  are  in  the  octants  of  the  sun,  and  vanishes  when  they  are  in  the \nsyzygies  or  quadratures  ;  and  in  other  positions  of  the  nodes  is  propor \ntional  to  the  sine  of  double  the  distance  of  either  node  from  the  nearest \nsyzygy  or  quadrature. And  it  is  added  to  the  mean  motion  of  the  moon, \nif  the  sun  is  in  antecedentia,  to  the  node  which  is  nearest  to  him,  and \nsubducted  if  in  consequential  and  in  the  octants,  where  it  is  of  the \ngreatest  magnitude,  it  arises  to  47\"  in  the  mean  distance  of  the  sun  from \nthe  earth,  as  I  find  from  the  theory  of  gravity.", "the  mean  distance  of  the  sun  from \nthe  earth,  as  I  find  from  the  theory  of  gravity.

By  the  same  theory  of  gravity,  the  moon's  apogee  goes  forward  at  the \ngreatest  rate  when  it  is  either  in  conjunction  with  or  in  opposition  to  the \nsun,  but  in  its  quadratures  with  the  sun  it  goes  backward  ;  and  the  ec \ncentricity  comes,  in  the  former  case,  to  its  greatest  quantity  ;  in  the  latter \nto  its  least,  by  Cor. 7,  8,  and  9,  Prop.

The  former  of  those  heights  ari \nses  from  the  sum  of  the  aforesaid  forces,  the  latter  from  their  difference. If,  therefore,  S  and  L  are  supposed  to  represent  respectively  the  forces  of \nthe  sun  arid  moon  while  they  are  in  the  equator,  as  well  as  in  their  mean \ndistances  from  the  earth,  we  shall  have  L  +  S  to  L  \u2014  S  as  45  to  25,  or  as \n9  to  5. At  Plymouth  (by  the  observations  of  Samuel  Colepress)  the  tide  in  its \nmean  height  rises  to  about  16  feet,  and  in  the  spring  and  autumn  tlu- \nheight  thereof  in  the  syzygies  may  exceed  that  in  the  quadratures  by  more \nthan  7  or  8  feet.", "thereof  in  the  syzygies  may  exceed  that  in  the  quadratures  by  more \nthan  7  or  8  feet. Suppose  the  greatest  difference  of  those  heights  to  be  9 \nfeet,  and  L  -f  S  will  be  to  L  \u2014  S  as  20 \u00a3  to  ll|,  or  as  41  to  23;  a  pro \nportion  that  agrees  well  enough  with  the  former. But  because  of  the  great \ntide  at  Bristol,  we  are  rather  to  depend  upon  the  observations  of  Sturmy  ; \nand,  therefore,  till  we  procure  something  that  is  more  certain,  we  shall  use \nthe  proportion  of  9  to  5. But  because  of  the  reciprocal  motions  of  the  waters,  the  greatest  tides  do \nnot  happen  at  the  times  of  the  syzygies  of  the  luminaries,  but,  as  we  have \nsaid  before,  are  the  third  in  order  after  the  syzygies ;  or  (reckoning  from \nthe  syzygies)  follow  next  after  the  third  appulse  of  the  moon  to  the  me \nridian  of  the  place  after  the  syzygies ;  or  rather  (as  Sturmy  observes)  are \nthe  third  after  the  day  of  the  new  or  full  moon,  or  rather  nearly  after  the \ntwelfth  hour  from  the  new  or  full  moon,  and  therefore  fall  nearly  upon  the \nforty-third  hour  after  the  new  or  full  of  the  moon.", "nd  therefore  fall  nearly  upon  the \nforty-third  hour  after  the  new  or  full  of  the  moon.

So  the \nsummer  and  winter  seasons  come  not  to  their  height  in  the  solstices  them \nselves,  but  when  the  sun  is  advanced  beyuni  the  solstices  by  about  a  tenth \npart  of  its  whole  course,  that  is,  by  about  36  or  37  degrees. In  like  man \nner,  the  greatest  tide  is  raised  after  the  appulse  of  the  moon  to  the  meridian \nof  the  place,  when  the  moon  has  passed  by  the  sun,  or  the  opposition  thereof. by  .about  a  tenth  part  of  the  whole  motion  from  one  greatest  tide  to  the \nnext  following  greatest  tide.", "part  of  the  whole  motion  from  one  greatest  tide  to  the \nnext  following  greatest  tide.

But  farther ;  the  force  of  tne  moon  in  the  quadratures  must  be  dimin \nished,  on  account  of  its  declination  from  the  equator ;  for  the  moon  in \nthose  quadratures,  or  rather  in  18^  degrees  past  the  quadratures,  declines \nfrom  the  equator  by  about  23\u00b0  13';  and  the  force  of  either  luminary  to \nmove  the  sea  is  diminished  as  it  declines  from  the  equator  nearly  in  the \nduplicate  proportion  of  the  co-sine  of  the  declination  ;  and  therefore  the \nforce  of  the  moon  in  those  quadratures  is  only  0.85703271. ;  whence  we \nhave  L+0,7986355S  to  0,8570327L  \u2014  0,79863558  as  9  to  5.", "s  only  0.85703271. ;  whence  we \nhave  L+0,7986355S  to  0,8570327L  \u2014  0,79863558  as  9  to  5.

But  the  force  of  the  moon  to  move  the  sea  is  in \nthe  reciprocal  triplicate  proportion  of  its  distance ;  and  therefore  its \nforces,  in  the  greatest  and  least  of  those  distances,  are  to  its  force  in  its \nmean  distance  ;is  0.9830427  and  1,017522  to  1.

Because  the  force  of  the  moon  to  move  the  sea  is  to  the  like \nforce  of  the  sun  as  4,4815  to  1,  and  those  forces  (by  Cor. 14,  Prop.", "is  to  the  like \nforce  of  the  sun  as  4,4815  to  1,  and  those  forces  (by  Cor. 14,  Prop. LXVI, \nBook  1)  are  as  the  densities  of  the  bodies  of  the  sun  and  moon  and  the \ncubes  of  their  apparent  diameters  conjunctly,  the  density  of  the  moon  will \nbe  to  the  density  of  the  sun  as  4,4815  to  1  directly,  and  the  cube  of  the \nmoon's  diameter  to  the  cube  of  the  sun's  diameter  inversely  ;  that  is  (see \ning  the  mean  apparent  diameters  of  the  moon  and  sun  are  31'  161\",  and \n32'  12\"),  as  4891  to  1000. But  the  density  of  the  sun  was  to  the  den \nsity  of  the  earth  as  1000  to  4000;  and  therefore  the  density  of  the  moon \nis  to  the  density  of  the  earth  as  4891  to  4000,  or  as  11  to  9. Therefore \nthe  body  of  the  moon  is  more  dense  and  more  earthly  than  the  earth \nitself. COR. 4. And  since  the  true  diameter  of  the  moon  (from  the  observations \nof  astronomers)  is  to  the  true  diameter  of  the  earth  as  100  to  365,  the \nmass  of  matter  in  the  moon  will  be  to  the  mass  of  matter  in  the  earth  as \n1  to  39,788. Cor. 5. And  the  accelerative  gravity  on  the  surface  of  the  moon  will  be", "30OK  HI.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 453 \nabout  three  times  less  than  the  accelerative  gravity  on  the  surface  of  thr \nearth. COR. 6. And  the  distance  of  the  moon's  centre  from  the  centre  of  the \nearth  will  be  to  the  distance  of  the  moon's  centre  from  the  common  centre \nof  gravity  of  the  earth  and  moon  as  40,783  to  39,788. COR. 7. And  the  mean  distance  of  the  centre  of  the  moon  from  the \ncentre  of  the  earth  will  be  (in  the  moon's  octants)  nearly  60f  of  the  great \nest  semi-diameters  of  the  earth;  for  the  greatest  semi- diameter  of  the \nearth  was  1 9658600  Paris  feet,  and  the  mean  distance  of  the  centres  of \nthe  earth  and  moon,  consisting  of  60|  such  semi-diameters,  is  equal  to \n1187379440  feet. And  this  distance  (by  the  preceding  Cor.)  is  to  the  dis \ntance  of  the  moon's  centre  from  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the \nearth  and  moon  as  40.788  to  39,788  :  which  latter  distance,  therefore,  is \n1158268534  feet. And  since  the  moon,  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  per \nforms  its  revolution  in  27d. 7h.", "d  since  the  moon,  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  per \nforms  its  revolution  in  27d. 7h. 43f ',  the  versed  sine  of  that  angle  which \nthe  moon  in  a  minute  of  time  describes  is  12752341  to  the  radius \n1000,000000,000000;  and  as  the  radius  is  to  this  versed  sine,  so  are \n1158268534  feet  to  147706353  feet. The  moon,  therefore,  falling  tow \nards  the  earth  by  that  force  which  retains  it  in  its  orbit,  would  in  one \nminute  of  time  describe  147706353  feet ;  and  if  we  augment  this  force \nin  the  proportion  of  17Sf  \u00a3  to  l?7\u00a3-\u00a7,  we  shall  have  the  total  force  of \ngravity  at  the  orbit  of  the  moon,  by  Cor. Prop. Ill ;  and  the  moon  falling \nby  this  force,  in  one  minute  of  time  would  describe  14.8538067  feet. And \nat  the  60th  part  of  the  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  earth's  centre,  that \nis,  at  the  distance  of  197896573  feet  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  a  body \nfalling  by  its  weight,  would,  in  one  second  of  time,  likewise  describe \n14,8538067  feet. And,  therefore,  at  the  distance  of  19615800,  which \ncompose  one  mean  serni -diameter  of  the  earth,  a  heavy  body  would  de \nscribe  in  falling  15,11175,  or  15  feet,  1  inch,  and  4^  lines,  in  the  same \ntime.", "de \nscribe  in  falling  15,11175,  or  15  feet,  1  inch,  and  4^  lines,  in  the  same \ntime. This  will  be  the  descent  of  bodies  in  the  latitude  of  45  degrees. And  by  the  foregoing  table,  to  be  found  under  Prop. XX,  the  descent  in \nthe  latitude  of  Paris  will  be  a  little  greater  by  an  excess  of  about  |  parts \nof  a  line. Therefore,  by  this  computation,  heavy  bodies  in  the  latitude  of \nParis  falling  in  vacno  will  describe  15  Paris  feet,  1  inch,  4|f  lines,  very \nnearly,  in  one  second  of  time. And  if  the  gravity  be  diminished  by  tak \ning  away  a  quantity  equal  to  the  centrifugal  force  arising  in  that  latitude \n.\"rom  the  earth's  diurnal  motion,  heavy  bodies  falling  there  will  describe \nin  one  second  of  time  15  feet,  1  inch,  and  l\u00a3  line. And  with  this  velo \ncity  heavy  bodies  do  really  fall  in  the  latitude  of  Paris,  as  we  have  shewn \nabove  in  Prop. IV  and  XIX. COR. 8. The  mean  distance  of  the  centres  of  the  earth  and  moon  in  the \nsyzygies  of  the  moon  is  equal  to  60  of  the  greatest  semi-diameters  of  the \nearth,  subducting  only  about  one  30th  par1;  of  a  semi-  diameter :  and  in  the", "45.4  THE  MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  III, \nmoon's  quadratures  the  mean  distance  of  the  same  centres  is  60f  such  semi- \ndiameters  of  the  earth ;  for  these  two  distances  are  to  the  mean  distance  oi \nthe  moon  in  the  octants  as  69  and  70  to  69|,  by  Prop.

PROPOSITION  XXXVIII. PROBLEM  XIX. To  find  the  figure  of  the  moon's  body. If  the  moon's  body  were  fluid  like  our  sea,  the  force  of  the  earth  to  raise \nthat  fluid  in  the  nearest  and  remotest  parts  would  be  to  the  force  of  the \nmoon  by  which  our  sea  is  raised  in  the  places  under  and  opposite  to  the \nmoon  as  the  accelerative  gravity  of  the  moon  towards  the  earth  to  the  ac- \ncelerative  gravity  of  the  earth  towards  the  moon,  and  the  diameter  of  the \nmoon  to  the  diameter  of  the  earth  conjunctly ;  that  is,  as  39,788  to  1,  and \n100  to  365  conjunctly,  or  as  1081  to  100.", "conjunctly ;  that  is,  as  39,788  to  1,  and \n100  to  365  conjunctly,  or  as  1081  to  100. Wherefore,  since  our  sea,  by \nthe  force  of  the  moon,  is  raised  to  Sf  feet,  the  lunar  fluid  would  be  raised \nby  the  force  of  the  earth  to  93  feet ;  and  upon  this  account  the  figure  of \nthe  moon  would  be  a  spheroid,  whose  greatest  diameter  produced  would \npass  through  the  centre  of  the  earth,  and  exceed  the  diameters  perpendicu \nlar  thereto  by  186  feet. Such  a  figure,  therefore,  the  moon  affects,  and \nmust  have  put  on  from  the  beginning. Q.E.I. COR. Hence  it  is  that  the  same  face  of  the  moon  always  respects  the \nearth ;  nor  can  the  body  of  the  moon  possibly  rest  in  any  other  position, \nbut  would  return  always  by  a  libratory  motion  to  this  situation ;  but  those \nlibrations,  however,  must  be  exceedingly  slow,  because  of  the  weakness  of \nthe  forces  which  excite  them ;  so  that  the  face  of  the  moon,  which  should \nbe  always  obverted  to  the  earth,  may,  for  the  reason  assigned  in  Prop.

As  the  comets  were  placed  by  astronomers  above  the  moon,  because  they \nwere  found  to  have  no  diurnal  parallax,  so  their  annual  parallax  is  a  con \nvincing  proof  of  their  descending  into  the  regions  of  the  planets ;  for  all \nthe  comets  which  move  in  a  direct  course  according  to  the  order  of  the \nsigns,  about  the  end  of  their  appearance  become  more  than  ordinarily  slow \nor  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun ;  and  more  than \nordinarily  swift,  if  the  earth  is  approaching  to  a  heliocentric  opposition \nwith  them ;  whereas,  on  the  other  hand,  those  which  move  against  the  or \nder  of  the  signs,  towards  the  end  of  their  appearance  appear  swifter  than \nthey  ought  to  be,  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun ;  and  slower, \nand  perhaps  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  in  the  other  side  of  its  orbit.", "and  slower, \nand  perhaps  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  in  the  other  side  of  its  orbit.

The  angle, \ntherefore,  FQG,  which  is  the  difference  of  the  longitude,  proceeds  from  the \ninequality  of  the  motions  of  the  comet  and  the  earth ;  and  this  angle,  if \nthe  earth  and  cornet  move  contrary  ways,  is  added  to  the  angle  TQ,G,  and \naccelerates  the  apparent  motion  of  the  comet ;  but  if  the  comet  move  the \nsame  way  with  the  earth,  it  is  subtracted,  and  either  retards  the  motion  ol \nthe  comet,  or  perhaps  renders  it  retrograde,  as  we  have  but  now  explained. This  angle,  therefore,  proceeding  chiefly  from  the  motion  of  the  earth,  is \njustly  to  be  esteemed  the  parallax  of  the  comet;  neglecting,  to  wit,  some \nlittle  increment  or  decrement  that  may  arise  from  the  unequal  motion  of \nthe  comet  in  its  orbit :  and  from  this  parallax  we  thus  deduce  the  distance \nof  the  comet. Let  S  represent  the  sun,  acT  v \nthe  orbis  tnagnus,  a  the  earth's  place  in  the \nfirst  observatiun,  c  the  place  of  the  earth  in \nthe  third  observation,  T  the  place  of  the \nearth  in  the  last  observation,  and  TT  a  right \nline  drawn  to  the  beginning  of  Aries.", "earth  in  the  last  observation,  and  TT  a  right \nline  drawn  to  the  beginning  of  Aries.

And  this  place  V  is  commonly  lower  than  the  orb  of  Jupiter.", "he  plane  of  the \necliptic. And  this  place  V  is  commonly  lower  than  the  orb  of  Jupiter. The  same  thing  may  be  deduced  from  the  incurvation  of  the  way  of  the \ncomets ;  for  these  bodies  move  almost  in  great  circles,  while  their  velocity \nis  great ;  but  about  the  end  of  their  course,  when  that  part  of  their  appa \nrent  motion  which  arises  from  the  parallax  bears  a  greater  proportion  to \ntheir  whole  apparent  motion,  they  commonly  deviate  from  those  circles,  and \nwhen  the  earth  goes  to  one  side,  they  deviate  to  the  other :  and  this  deflex \nion,  because  of  its  corresponding  with  the  motion  of  the  earth,  must  arise \nchiefly  from  the  parallax ;  and  the  quantity  thereof  is  so  considerable,  as, \nby  my  computation,  to  place  the  disappearing  comets  a  good  deal  lower \nthan  Jupiter. Whence  it  follows  that  when  they  approach  nearer  to  us  in \ntheir  perigees  and  perihelions  they  often  descend  below  the  orbs  of  Mare \nand  the  inferior  planets.", "462  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    JJI, \nThe  near  approach  of  the  comets  is  farther  confirmed  from  the  light  of \ntb.eir  heads;  for  the  light  of  a  celestial  body,  illuminated  by  the  sun,  and \nreceding  to  remote  parts,  is  diminished  in  the  quadruplicate  proportion  of \nthe  distance;  to  wit,  in  one  duplicate  proportion,  on  account  of  the  increase \nof  the  distance  from  the  sun,  and  in  another  duplicate  proportion,  on  ac \ncount  of  the  decrease  of  the  apparent  diameter. Wherefore  if  both  the \nquantity  of  light  and  the  apparent  diameter  of  a  comet  are  given,  its  dis \ntance  will  be  also  given,  by  taking  the  distance  of  the  comet  to  the  distance \nof  ;i  planet  in  the  direct  proportion  of  their  diameters  and  the  reciprocal \nsubduplicate  proportion  of  their  lights. Thus,  in  the  comet  of  the  year \n1682,  Mr.", "rocal \nsubduplicate  proportion  of  their  lights. Thus,  in  the  comet  of  the  year \n1682,  Mr. Flamsted  observed  with  a  telescope  of  16  feet,  and  measured \nwith  a  micrometer,  the  least  diameter  of  its  head;  2'  00;  but  the  nucleus \nor  star  in  the  middle  of  the  head  scarcely  amounted  to  the  tenth  part  of \nthis  measure;  and  therefore  its  diameter  was  only  11\"  or  12\"  \u2022  but  in  the \nlight  and  splendor  of  its  head  it  surpassed  that  of  the  comet  in  the  year \n1680;  and  might  be  compared  with  the  stars  of  the  lirst  or  second  magni \ntude. Let  us  suppose  that  Saturn  with  its  ring  was  about  four  times  more \nlucid ;  and  because  the  light  of  the  ring  was  almost  equal  to  the  light  of \nthe  globe  within,  and  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  globe  is  about  21\",  and \ntherefore  the  united  light  of  both  globe  and  ring  would  be  equal  to  the \nlight  of  a  globe  whose  diameter  is  30\",  it  follows  that  the  distance  of  th \ncomet  was  to  the  distance  of  Saturn  as  1  to  v/4  inversely,  and  12\"  to  30 \ndirectly ;  that  is,  as  24  to  30,  or  4  to  5.", "as  1  to  v/4  inversely,  and  12\"  to  30 \ndirectly ;  that  is,  as  24  to  30,  or  4  to  5. Again ;  the  comet  in  the  month \nof  April  1665,  as  Hevelius  informs  us,  excelled  almost  all  the  fixed  stars \nin  splendor,  and  even  Saturn  itself,  as  being  of  a  much  more  vivid  colour ; \nfor  this  comet  was  more  lucid  than  that  other  which  had  appeared  about \nthe  end  of  the  preceding  year,  and  had  been  compared  to  the  stars  of  the \nh'rst  magnitude. The  diameter  of  its  head  was  about  6' ;  but  the  nucleus, \ncompared  with  the  planets  by  means  of  a  telescope,  was  plainly  less  than \nJupiter ;  and  sometimes  judged  less,  sometimes  judged  equal,  to  the  globe \nof  Saturn  within  the  ring. Since,  then,  the  diameters  of  the  heads  of  the \ncomets  seldom  exceed  8'  or  12;,  and  the  diameter  of  the  nucleus  or  central \nstar  is  but  about  a  tenth  or  perhaps  fifteenth  part  of  the  diameter  of  the \nhead,  it  appears  that  these  stars  are  generally  of  about  the  same  apparent \nmagnitude  with  the  planets.", "that  these  stars  are  generally  of  about  the  same  apparent \nmagnitude  with  the  planets. But  in  regard  that  their  light  may  be  often \ncompared  with  the  light  of  Saturn,  yea,  and  sometimes  exceeds  it,  it  is  evi \ndent  that  all  comets  in  their  perihelions  must  either  be  placed  below  or  not \nfar  above  Saturn ;  and  they  are  much  mistaken  who  remove  them  almost \nas  far  as  the  fixed  stars ;  for  if  it  was  so,  the  comets  could  receive  no  more \nlight  from  our  sun  than  our  planets  do  from  the  fixed  stars. So  far  we  have  gone,  without  considering  the  obscuration  which  comets \nsuffer  from  that  plenty  of  thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads, \nand  through  which  the  heads  always  shew  dull,  as  through  i  cloud;  for  by", "BoOK  Hl.J  Or    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 463 \nhow  much  the  more  a  body  is  obscured  by  this  smoke,  by  so  much  the  more \nnear  it  must  be  allowed  to  come  to  the  sun,  that  it  may  vie  with  the  plan- \neta  in  the  quantity  of  light  which  it  reflects. Whence  it  is  probable  that \nthe  comets  descend  far  below  the  orb  of  Saturn,  as  we  proved  before  frou \ntheir  parallax. But,  above  all,  the  thing  is  evinced  from  their  tails,  which \nmust  be  owing  either  to  the  sun's  light  reflected  by  a  smoke  arising  from \nthem,  and  dispersing  itself  through  the  aether,  or  to  the  light  of  their  own \nheads. In  the  former  case,  we  must  shorten  the  distance  of  the  comets, \nlest  we  be  obliged  to  allow  that  the  smoke  arising  from  their  heads  is \npropagated  through  such  a  vast  extent  of  space,  and  with  such  a  velocity \nand  expansion  as  will  seem  altogether  incredible ;  in  the  latter  case,  the \nwhole  light  of  both  head  arid  tail  is  to  be  ascribed  to  the  central  nucleus. But. then,  if  we  suppose  all  this  light  to  be  united  and  condensed  within \nthe  disk  of  the  nucleus,  certainly  the  nucleus  will  by  far  exceed  Jupiter \nitself  in  splendor,  especially  when  it  emits  a  very  large  and  lucid  tail  If.", "Jupiter \nitself  in  splendor,  especially  when  it  emits  a  very  large  and  lucid  tail  If. therefore,  under  a  less  apparent  diameter,  it  reflects  more  light,  it  must  be \nmuch  more  illuminated  by  the  sun,  and  therefore  much  nearer  to  it;  and \nthe  same  argument  will  bring  down  the  heads  of  comets  sometimes  within \nthe  orb  of  Venus,  viz.,  when,  being  hid  under  the  sun's  rays,  they  emit  such \nhuge  and  splendid  tails,  like  beams  of  fire,  as  sometimes  they  do  ;  for  if  all \nthat  light  was  supposed  to  be  gathered  together  into  one  star,  it  would \nsometimes  exceed  not  one  Venus  only,  but  a  great  many  such  united \ninto  one. Lastly ;  the  same  thing  is  inferred  from  the  light  of  the  heads,  which \nincreases  in  the  recess  of  the  cornets  from  the  earth  towards  the  sun,  and \ndecreases  in  their  return  from  the  sun  towards  the  earth  ;  for  so  the  comet \nof  the  year  1665  (by  the  observations  of  Hevelius],  from  the  time  that  it \nwas  first  seen,  was  always  losing  of  its  apparent  motion,  and  therefore  had \nalready  passed  its  perigee  ;  but  yet  the  splendor  of  its  head  was  daily  in \ncreasing,  till,  being  hid  under  the  sun's  rays,  the  comet  ceased  to  appear.", "daily  in \ncreasing,  till,  being  hid  under  the  sun's  rays,  the  comet  ceased  to  appear. The  comet  of  the  year  1683  (by  the  observations  of  the  same  LJevelius), \nabout  the  end  of  July,  when  it  first  appeared,  moved  at  a  very  slow  rate, \nadvancing  only  about  40  or  45  minutes  in  its  orb  in  a  day's  time ;  but \nfrom  that  time  its  diurnal  motion  was  continually  upon  the  increase,  till \nSeptember  4,  when  it  arose  to  about  5  degrees ;  and  therefore,  in  all  this \ninterval  of  time,  the  comet  was  approaching  to  the  earth. Which  is  like \nwise  proved  from  the  diameter  of  its  head,  measured  with  a  micrometer ; \nfor,  August  6,  Hevelius  found  it  only  6'  05\",  including  the  coma,  which, \nSeptember  2  he  observed  to  be  9'  07\",  and  therefore  its  head  appeared  far \nless  about,  the  beginning  than  towards  the  end  of  the  motion  ;  though \nabout  the  beginning,  because  nearer  to  the  sun,  it  appeared  far  more  lucid \nthan  towards  the  end,  as  the  same  Hevelius  declares.

The  comet  of \nthe  year  1618,  about  the  middle  of  December,  and  that  of  the  year  1680, \nabout  the  end  of  the  same  month,  did  both  move  with  their  greatest  velo \ncity,  and  were  therefore  then  in  their  perigees  :  but  the  greatest  splendor \nof  their  heads  was  seen  two  weeks  before,  when  they  had  just  got  clear  of \nthe  sun's  rays  ;  and  the  greatest  splendor  of  their  tails  a  little  more  early, \nwhen  yet  nearer  to  the  sun. The  head  of  the  former  comet  (according  to \nthe  observations  of  Cysdtus],  Dece/itber  1,  appeared  greater  than  the  stars \nof ^ the  first  magnitude:  and,  December  16  (then  in  the  perigee),  it  was \nbut  little  diminished  in  magnitude,  but  in  the  splendor  and  brightness  of \nits  light  a  great  deal.

De \ncember  15  and  17,  it  appeared  as  a  star  of  the  third  magnitude,  its  lustre \nbeing  diminished  by  the  brightness  of  the  clouds  near  the  setting  sun. December  26,  when  it  moved  with  the  greatest  velocity,  being  almost  in \nits  perigee,  it  was  less  than  the  mouth  of  Pegasus,  a  star  of  the  third \nmagnitude.

If  we  compare  equal  intervals  of  time  on  one \nside  and  on  the  other  from  the  perigee,  we  shall  find  that  the  head  of  the \ncomet,  which  at  both  intervals  of  time  was  far,  but  yet  equally,  removed \nfrom  the  earth,  and  should  have  therefore  shone  with  equal  splendor,  ap \npeared  brightest  on  the  side  of  the  perigee  towards  the  sun,  and  disap \npeared  on  the  other.", "brightest  on  the  side  of  the  perigee  towards  the  sun,  and  disap \npeared  on  the  other.

Therefore  the  comets  shine  by  the  sun's  light,  which  they  reflect. COR. 2. From  what  has  been  said,  we  may  likewise  understand  why \ncomets  are  so  frequently  seen  in  that  hemisphere  in  which  the  sun  is,  and \nso  seldom  in  the  other. If  they  were  visible  in  the  regions  far  above \nSaturn,  they  would  appear  more  frequently  in  the  parts  opposite  to  the \nsun ;  for  such  as  were  in  those  parts  would  be  nearer  to  the  earth,  whereas \nthe  presence  of  the  sun  must  obscure  and  hide  those  that  appear  in  the \nhemisphere  in  which  he  is.", "of  the  sun  must  obscure  and  hide  those  that  appear  in  the \nhemisphere  in  which  he  is. Yet,  looking  over  the  history  of  comets,  I \nfind  that  four  or  five  times  more  have  been  seen  in  the  hemisphere  towards \nthe  sun  than  in  the  opposite  hemisphere ;  besides,  without  doubt,  not  a \nfew,  which  have  been  hid  by  the  light  of  the  sun :  for  comets  descending", "BOOK  III.]  0*     NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. !fi5 \ninto  our  parts  neither  emit  tails,  nor  are  so  well  illuminated  by  the  sun, \nas  to  discover  themselves  to  our  naked  eyes,  until  they  are  come  nearer  to \nus  than  Jupiter. But  the  far  greater  part  of  that  spherical  space,  which \nis  described  about  the  sun  with  so  small  an  interval,  lies  on  that  side  of \nthe  earth  which  regards  the  sun  ;  and  the  comets  in  that  greater  part  are \ncommonly  more  strongly  illuminated,  as  being  for  the  most  part  nearer  to \nthe  sun. COR. 3. Hence  also  it  is  evident  that  the  celestial  spaces  are  void  of \nresistance  ;  for  though  the  comets  are  carried  in  oblique  paths,  and  some \ntimes  contrary  to  the  course  of  the  planets,  yet  they  move  every  way  with \nthe  greatest  freedom,  and  preserve  their  motions  for  an  exceeding  long \ntime,  even  where  contrary  to  the  course  of  the  planets.", "motions  for  an  exceeding  long \ntime,  even  where  contrary  to  the  course  of  the  planets. I  am  out  in  my \njudgment  if  they  are  not  a  sort  of  planets  revolving  in  orbits  returning \ninto  themselves  with  a  perpetual  motion  ;  for,  as  to  what  some  writers \ncontend,  that  they  are  no  other  than  meteors,  led  into  this  opinion  by  the \nperpetual  changes  that  happen  to  their  heads,  it  seems  to  have  no  founda \ntion  ;  for  the  heads  of  comets  are  encompassed  with  huge  atmospheres, \nand  the  lowermost  parts  of  these  atmospheres  must  be  the  densest ;  and \ntherefore  it  is  in  the  clouds  only,  not  in  the  bodies  of  the  comets  them \nselves,  that  these  changes  are  seen. Thus  the  earth,  if  it  was  viewed  from \nthe  planets,  would,  without  all  doubt,  shine  by  the  light  of  its  clouds,  and \nthe  solid  body  would  scarcely  appear  through  the  surrounding  clouds. Thus  also  the  belts  of  Jupiter  are  formed  in  the  clouds  of  tha\u00abt  planet, \nfor  they  change  their  position  one  to  another,  and  the  solid  body  of  Jupiter \nis  hardly  to  be  seen  through  them  ;  and  much  more  must  the  bodies  of \ncomets  be  hid  under  their  atmospheres,  which  are  both  deeper  and  thicker.

That  the  comets  mnve  in  some  of  the  conic  sections,  having  their  foci \nin  the  centre  of  the  sun ;  and  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun  describe \nareas  proportional  to  the  times. This  proposition  appears  from  Cor. 1,  Prop. XIII,  Book  1,  compared \n\u2022vith  Prop. VIII,  XII,  and  XIII,  Book  HI. COR. 1. Hence  if  comets  are  revolved  in  orbits  returning  into  them \nselves,  those  orbits  will  be  ellipses ;  and  their  periodic  times  be  to  the \nperiodic  times  of  the  planets  in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  prin \ncipal  axes. And  therefore  the  comets,  which  for  the  most  part  of  their \ncourse  are  higher  than  the  planets,  and  upon  that  account  describe  orbits \nwith  greater  axes,  will  require  a  longer  time  to  finish  their  revolutions. Thus  if  the  axis  of  a  comet's  orbit  was  four  times  greater  than  the  axis \nof  the  orbit  of  Saturn,  the  time  of  the  revolution  of  the  comet  would  be \nto  the  time  of  the  revolution  of  Saturn,  that  is,  to  30  years,  as  4  ^/  4 \n(or  8)  to  1,  and  would  therefore  be  240  years. 30", "THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  III.

XVI,  Book  1,  the  velocity  of \nevery  comet  will  always  be  to  the  velocity  of  any  planet,  supposed  to  be \nrevolved  at  the  same  distance  in  a  circle  about  the  sun,  nearly  in  the  sub- \nduplicate  proportion  of  double  the  distance  of  the  planet  from  the  centre \nof  the  sun  to  the  distance  of  the  comet  from  the  sun's  centre,  very  nearly. Let  us  suppose  the  radius  of  the  or  bis  wag  mis,  or  the  greatest  semi- \ndiameter  of  the  ellipsis  which  the  earth  describes,  to  consist  of  100000000 \nparts ;  and  then  the  earth  by  its  mean  diurnal  motion  will  describe \n1720212  of  those  parts,  and  716751  by  its  horary  motion.

But  the  comet  being  then  extremely  near  the  horizon,  was  scarcely  discern \nible,  and  therefore  its  place  could  not  be  determined  with  that  certainty  as \nin  the  foregoing  observations.

In  the  foregoing  table  we  have  omitted  the  observations  of  Nov. 16, \n18,  20. and  23,  as  not  sufficiently  accurate,  for  at  those  times  several  per \nsons  had  observed  the  comet.

Ponthczns  and  his  compan \nions,  at  6h. in  the  morning  at  Rome  (that  is,  5h. 10'  at  London],  by  threads \ndirected  to  the  fixed  stars,  observed  the  comet  in  ===  8\u00b0  30',  with  latitude  0\u00b0 \n40'  south. Their  observations  may  be  seen  in  a  treatise  which  Ponthc&us \npublished  concerning  this  comet. Celliits,  who  was  present,  and  commu \nnicated  his  observations  in  a  letter  to  Cassitn}  saw  the  comet  at  the  same \nhour  in  ^=  8\u00b0  30',  with  latitude  0\u00b0  30'  south. It  was  likewise  seen  by \nGalletius  at  the  same  hour  at  Avignon  (that  is,  at  5h. 42'  morning  at \nLondon]  in  ^=  8\u00b0  without  latitude. But  by  the  theory  the  comet  was  at \nthat  time  in  ^  8\u00b0  16'  45\",  and  its  latitude  was  0\u00b0  53'  7\"  south. Nov. 18,  at  6h. 30'  in  the  morning  at  Rome  (that  is,  at  5h. 40'  at  Lon \ndon),  PonthcEns  observed  the  comet  in  ^  13\u00b0  30',  with  latitude  1\u00b0  20", "BOOK  III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHII  OSOPHY. 48l \nsouth ;  and  Cellius  in  ^  13\u00b0  30',  with  latitude  1\u00b0  00'  south. But  at  5b. 30'  in  the  morning  at  Aviation,  Galletius  saw  it  in  ^  13\u00b0  00',  with  lati \ntude  1\u00b0  00'  south. In  the  University  of  La  Fleche,  in  Prance,  at  5h. in \nthe  morning  (that  is. at  5h. 9'  at  London.},  it  was  seen  by  P. An  go,  in  the \nmiddle  between  two  small  stars,  one  of  which  is  the  middle  of  the  three \nwhich  lie  in  a  right  line  in  the  southern  hand  of  Virgo,  Bayers  i/> ;  and \nthe  other  is  the  outmost  of  the  wing,  Bayer  s  0. Whence  the  comet  was \nthen  in  ^  12\u00b0  46'  with  latitude  50'  south. And  I  was  informed  by  Dr. ffalley,  that  on  the  same  day  at  Boston  in  New  England,  in  the  latitude \nof  42|  deg. at  5h. in  the  morning  (that  is,  at  9h. 44'  in  the  morning  at \nLondon),  the  comet  was  seen  near  ===  14\u00b0,  with  latitude  1\u00b0  30'  south. Nov. 19,  at  4|h. at  Cambridge,  the  comet  (by  the  observation  of  a \nyoung  man)  was  distant  from  Spica  '$  about  2\u00b0  towards  the  north  west. Now  the  spike  was  at  that  time  in  ^  19\u00b0  23'  47\",  with  latitude  2\u00b0  1'  59\" \nsouth.

The  same  day,  in  the  island  of  Jamaica,  it  was  about  1\u00b0  distant \nfrom  Spica  W. The  same  day,  Mr. Arthur  Storer,  at  the  river  Patuxent, \nnear  Hunting  Creek,  in  Maryland,  in  the  confines  of  Virginia,  in  lat. 38i\u00b0,  at  5  in  the  morning  (that  is,  at  10h. at  London),  saw  the  comet \nabove  Spica  W,  and  very  nearly  joined  with  it,  the  distance  between  them \nbeing  about  \u00a3  of  one  deg. And  from  these  observations  compared,  I  con \nclude,  that  at  9h. 44'  at  London,  the  comet  was  in  ===  18\u00b0  50',  with  about \n1\u00b0  25'  latitude  south. Now  by  the  theory  the  comet  was  at  that  time  in \n^  18\u00b0  52'  15\",  with  1\u00b0  26'  54\"  lat. south. Nov. 20,  Montenari,  professor  of  astronomy  at  Padua,  at  6h. in  the \nmorning  at  Venice  (that  is,  5h. 10'  at  London),  saw  the  comet  in  ===  23\u00b0, \nwith  latitude  1\u00b0  30'  south. The  same  day,  at  Boston,  it  was  distant  from \nSpica  W  by  about  4\u00b0  of  longitude  east,  and  therefore  was  in  ^  23\u00b0  24' \nnearly. Nov. 21,  Ponthceus  and  his  companions,  at  7|h. in  the  morning,  ob \nserved  the  comet  in  =\u00a3=  27\u00b0  50',  with  latitude  1\u00b0  16'  south ;  Cellius,  in  ^= \n28\u00b0  ;  P.", "rved  the  comet  in  =\u00a3=  27\u00b0  50',  with  latitude  1\u00b0  16'  south ;  Cellius,  in  ^= \n28\u00b0  ;  P. An  go  at  5h. in  the  morning,  in  ===  27\u00b0  45';  Montenari  in  ^ \n27\u00b0  51'. The  same  day,  in  the  island  of  Jamaica,  it  was  seen  near  the \nbeginning  of  ^1,  and  of  about  the  same  latitude  with  Spica  u%,  that  is,  2\u00b0 \n2'. The  same  day,  at  5h. morning,  at  Ballasore,  in  the  East  Indies  (that \nis,  at  llh. 20'  of  the  night  preceding  at  London),  the  distance  of  the \ncomet  from  Spica  W  was  taken  7\u00b0  35'  to  the  east. It  was  in  a  right  line \nbetween  the  spike  and  the  balance,  and  therefore  was  then  in  =\u00a3=  26\u00b0  58', \nwith  about  1\u00b0  11'  lat. south;  and  after  5h. 40'  (that  is. at  5h. morning  at \nLondon),  it  was  in  ===  28\u00b0  12'. with  1\u00b0  16'  lat. south. Now  by  the  theory \nthe  comet  was  then  in  *=  28\u00b0  10'  36\",  with  1\u00b0  53'  35\"  lat. south. Nov. 22,  the  comet  was  seen  by  Montenari  in  ^  2\u00b0  33' :  hut  at  Boston \n31", "482  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    111. in  New  England,  it  was  found  in  about  ^l  3\u00b0,  and  with  almost  the  same \nlatitude  as  before,  that  is,  1\u00b0  30'. The  same  day,  at  5h. morning  at \nBallasore,  the  comet  was  observed  in  ^l  1\u00b0  50' ;  and  therefore  at  5h. morn \ning  at  London,  the  comet  was  in  iU  3\u00b0  5'  nearly. The  same  day,  at  6^h. in  the  morning  at  London,  Dr. Hook  observed  it  in  about  nt  3\u00b0  30',  and \nthat  in  the  right  line  which  passeth  through  Spica  ^  and  Cor  Leonis  ; \nnot,  indeed,  exactly,  but  deviating  a  little  from  that  line  towards  the \nnorth. Montenari  likewise  observed,  that  this  day,  and  some  days  after, \na  right  line  drawn  from  the  comet  through  Spica  passed  by  the  south \nside  of  Cor  Lt>oi\\is  at  a  very  small  distance  therefrom. The  right  line \nthrough  Cor  Leonis  and  Spica  ^  did  cut  the  ecliptic  in  ^  3\u00b0  46'  at  an \nano-le  of  2\u00b0  51'  ;  and  if  the  comet  had  been  in  this  line  and  in  W. 3\u00b0,  its \nlatitude  would  have  been  2\u00b0  26'  ;  but  since  Hook  and  Montenari  agree \nthat  the  comet  was  at  some  small  distance  from  this  line  towards  the \nnorth,  its  latitude  must  have  been  something  less.", "distance  from  this  line  towards  the \nnorth,  its  latitude  must  have  been  something  less. On  the  20th,  by  the \nobservation  of  Montenari,  its  latitude  was  almost  the  same  with  that  of \nSpica  ^l7,  that  is,  about  1\u00b0  30'. But  by  the  agreement  of  Hook,  Monte- \nnari,  and  Align,  the  latitude  was  continually  increasing,  and  therefore \nmust  now,  on  the  22ci  be  sensibly  greater  than  t\u00b0  30' :  and,  taking  a \nmean  between  the  extreme  limits  but  now  stated. 2\u00b0  26'  and  1\u00b0  30',  the \nlatitude  will  be  about  1\u00b0  58'. Hook  and  Montenari  agree  that  the  tail \nof  the  comet  was  \"directed  towards  Spica  W,  declining  a  little  from  that \nstar  towards  the  south  according  to  Hook,  but  towards  the  north  according \nto  Montenari  ;  and,  therefore,  that  declination  was  scarcely  sensible ;  and \nthe  tail,  lying  nearly  parallel  to  the  equator,  deviated  a  little  from  the  op \nposition  of  the  sun  towards  the  north. Nov. 23,  O. S. at  51. morning,  at  Nuremberg  (that  is,  at  4^h. at  Lon \ndon),  Mr. Zimmerman  saw  the  comet  in  ^t  8\u00b0  8',  with  2\u00b0  31'  south  lat. its  place  being  collected  by  taking  its  distances  from  fixed  stars. Nov.", "31'  south  lat. its  place  being  collected  by  taking  its  distances  from  fixed  stars. Nov. 24,  before  sun-rising,  the  comet  was  seen  by  Montenari  in  TCI  1?\u00b0 \n52'  on  the  north  side  of  the  right  line  through  Cor  Leonis  and  Spica  W, \nand  therefore  its  latitude  was  something  less  than  2\u00b0  38' ;  and  since  the \nlatitude,  as  we  said,  by  the  concurring  observations  of  Montenari,  A/io-0, \nand  Hook,  was  continually  increasing,  therefore,  it  was  now,  on  the  24th, \nsomething  greater  than  1\u00b0  58\"  ;  and,  taking  the  mean  quantity,  may  be \nreckoned  2\u00b0  18\",  without  any  considerable  error. Ponthwns  and  Galletins \nwill  have  it  that  the  latitude  was  now  decreasing  ;  and  Cellius,  and  the \nobserver  in  New  England,  that  it  continued  the  same,  viz.,  of  about  1\u00b0, \nor  H\u00b0. The  observations  of  Ponthceus  and  Cellius  are  more  rude,  espe \ncially  those  which  were  made  by  taking  the  azimuths  and  altitudes ;  as \nare  also  the  observations  of  Galletins. Those  are  better  which  were \nmade  by  taking  the  position  of  the  comet  to  the  fixed  stars  by  Montenari^ \nHook,  Ango,  and  the  observer  in  New  England,  and  sometimes  by", "BOOK   III  |  O*     NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 4S3 \nPo  ii  t/tfe  n.fi  and  Cell'lus. The  same  day,  at  5h. morning,  at  Ballasore,  the \ncomet  was  observed  in  \"I  11\u00b0  45' ;  and,  therefore,  at  5h. morning  at  Lon \ndon,  was  in  \"I  13\u00b0  nearly. And,  by  the  theory,  the  comet  was  at  that \ntime  in  n  13\u00b0  22'  42\". Nov. 25,  before  sunrise. Montenari  observed  the  comet  in  1Tl  17| \nnearly  ;  and  Cellius  observed  at  the  same  time  that  the  comet  was  in  a \nright  line  between  the  bright'  star  in  the  right  thigh  of  Virgo  and  the \nsouthern  scale  of  Libra;  and  this  right  line  cuts  the  comet's  way  in  ^l \n18\u00b0  3(5'. And,  by  the  theory,  the  comet  was  in  ni  18-\u00a3-\u00b0  nearly. From  all  this  it  is  plain  that  these  observations  agree  with  the  theory, \nso  far  as  they  agree  with  one  another ;  and  by  this  agreement  it  is  made \nclear  that  it  was  one  and  the  same  comet  that  appeared  all  the  time  from \nNov. 4  to  Mar. 9. The  path  of  this  comet  did  twice  cut  the  plane  of  the \necliptic,  and  therefore  was  not  a  right  line.", "s  comet  did  twice  cut  the  plane  of  the \necliptic,  and  therefore  was  not  a  right  line. It  did  cut  the  ecliptic  not  in \nopposite  parts  of  the  heavens,  but  in  the  end  of  Virgo  and  beginning  of \nCapricorn,  including  an  arc  of  about  98\u00b0 :  and  therefore  the  way  of  the \ncomet  did  very  much  deviate  from  the  path  of  a  great  circle ;  for  in  the \nmonth  of  Nov. it  declined  at  least  3\u00b0  from  the  ecliptic  towards  the  south  : \nand  in  the  month  of  Dec. following  it  declined  29\u00b0  from  the  ecliptic  to \nwards  the  north  ;  the  two  parts  of  the  orbit  in  which  the  comet  descended \ntowards  the  sun,  and  ascended  again  from  the  sun,  declining  one  from  the \nother  by  an  apparent  angle  of  above  30\u00b0,  as  observed  by  Montenari. This \ncomet  travelled  over  9  signs,  to  wit,  from  the  last  dcg. of  \u00a31  to  the  begin \nning  of  n,  beside  the  sign  of  \u00a31,  through  wrhich  it  passed  before  it  began \nto  be  seen ;  and  there  is  no  other  theory  by  which  a  comet  can  go  over  so \ngreat  a  part  of  the  heavens  with  a  regular  motion. The  motion  of  this \ncomet  was  very  unequable ;  for  about  the  20th  of  Nov. it  described  about \n5\u00b0  a  day. Then  its  motion  being  retarded  between  Nov. 26  and  Dec.", "v. it  described  about \n5\u00b0  a  day. Then  its  motion  being  retarded  between  Nov. 26  and  Dec. 12,  to  wit,  in  the  space  of  15^  days,  it  described  only  40\u00b0'  But  the  mo \ntion  thereof  being  afterwards  accelerated,  it  described  near  5\u00b0  a  day,  till \nits  motion  began  to  be  again  retarded. And  the  theory  which  justly  cor \nresponds  with  a  motion  so  unequable,  and  through  so  great  a  part  of  the \nheavens,  which  observes  the  same  laws  with  the  theory  of  the  planets,  and \nwhich  accurately  agrees  with  accurate  astronomical  observations,  cannot \nbe  otherwise  than  true.

In  determining  the  length  of  the \ntail,  I  made  the  following  observations. \nNov.  4  and  6,  the  tail  did  not  appear ;  Nov.  1 1,  the  tail  just  begun  to \nshew  itself,  but  did  not  appear  above  |  deg.  long  through  a  10  feet  tele \nscope  ;  Nov.  17,  the  tail  was  seen  by  Ponthc&us  more  than  15\u00b0  long ;  Nov. \n18,  in  New- En  gland,  the  tail  appeared  30\u00b0  long,  and  directly  opposite  to \nthe  sun,  expending  itself  to  the  planet  Mars,  which  was  then  in  njZ,  9\u00b0  54  ; \nNov.  19.  in  Manjltnd,  the  tail  was  found  15\u00b0  or  20\u00b0  Ions:;  Dec.  10  (by", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 4S5 \nthe  observation  of  Mr. Flamsted),  the  tail  passed  through  the  middle  of \nthe  distance  intercepted  between  the  tail  of  the  Serpent  of  Ophiuchus  and \nthe  star  6  in  the  south  wing  of  Aquila,  and  did  terminate  near  the  stars \nA,  w,  l>,  in  Bayer's  tables. Therefore  the  end  of  the  tail  was  in  Y? 19|5; \nwith  latitude  about  34^\u00b0  north  ;  Dec  11,  it  ascended  to  the  head  of  Sag-it- \nta  (Bayer's  a,  0),  terminating  in  V? 26\u00b0  43',  with  latitude  38\u00b0  34'  north; \nDec. 12,  it  passed  through  the  middle  of  Sa^itta,  nor  did  it  reach  much \nfarther;  terminating  in  ~  4\u00b0,  with  latitude  42^\u00b0  north  nearly. But  these \nthings  are  to  be  understood  of  the  length  of  the  brighter  part  of  the  tail; \nfor  with  a  more  faint  light,  observed,  too,  perhaps,  in  a  serener  sky,  at \nRome,  Dec. 12,  5h. 40',  by  the  observation  of  Pon.thcBu.Sj  the  tail  arose  to \n10\u00b0  above  the  rump  of  the  Swan,  and  the  side  thereof  towards  the  west \nand  towards  the  north  was  45'  distant  from  this  star.", "e  side  thereof  towards  the  west \nand  towards  the  north  was  45'  distant  from  this  star. But  about  that  time \nthe  tail  was  3\u00b0  broad  towards  the  upper  end ;  and  therefore  the  middle \nthereof  was  2\u00b0  15'  distant  from  that  star  towards  the  south,  and  the  upper \nend  was  X  in  22\u00b0,  with  latitude  61\u00b0  north;  and  thence  the  tail  was  about \n70\u00b0  long;  Dec. 21,  it  extended  almost  to  Cassiopeia's  chair,  equally  dis \ntant  from  j3  and  from  Schedir,  so  as  its  distance  from  either  of  the  two \nwas  equal  to  the  distance  of  the  one  from  the  other,  and  therefore  did  ter \nminate  in  T  24\u00b0,  with  latitude  47^\u00b0  ;  Dec.", "one  from  the  other,  and  therefore  did  ter \nminate  in  T  24\u00b0,  with  latitude  47^\u00b0  ;  Dec. 29,  it  reached  to  a  contact  with \nScheal  on  its  left,  and  exactly  filled  up  the  space  between  the  two  stars  in \nthe  northern  foot  of  Andromeda,  being  54\u00b0  in  length;  and  therefore  ter \nminated  in  &  19\u00b0,  with  35\u00b0  of  latitude;  Jan  5,  it  touched  the  star  -rr  in \nthe  breast  of  Andromeda  on  its  right  side,  and  the  star  \\i  of  the  girdle  on \nits  left;  and,  according  to  our  observations,  was  40\u00b0  long;  but  it  was \ncurved,  and  the  convex  side  thereof  lay  to  the  south ;  arid  near  the  head  of \nthe  comet  it  made  an  angle  of  4\u00b0  with  the  circle  which  passed  through  the \nsun  and  the  comet's  head ;  but  towards  the  other  end  it  was  inclined  to \nthat  circle  in  an  angle  of  about  10\u00b0  or  11\u00b0  ;  and  the  chord  of  the  tail  con \ntained  with  that  circle  an  angle  of  8\u00b0. Jan. 13,  the  tail  terminated  be \ntween  Alamech  and  Algol,  with  a  light  that  was  sensible  enough  :  but \nwith  a  faint  light  it  ended  over  against  the  star  K  in  Perseus' s  side. The \ndistance  of  the  end  of  the  tail  from  the  circle  passing  through  the  sun  and \nthe  comet  was  3\u00b0  50' ;  and  the  inclination  of  the  chord  of  the  tail  to  that \ncircle  was  S|\u00b0.", "t  was  3\u00b0  50' ;  and  the  inclination  of  the  chord  of  the  tail  to  that \ncircle  was  S|\u00b0. Jan. 25  and  26,  it  shone  with  a  faint  light  to  the  length \nof  6\u00b0  or  7\u00b0 ;  and  for  a  night  or  two  after,  when  there  was  a  very  clear  sky. it  extended  to  the  length  of  12\u00b0. or  something  more,  with  a  light  that  was \nvery  faint  and  very  hardly  to  be  seen;  but  the  axis  thereof  was  exactly  di \nrected  to  the  bright  star  in  the  eastern  shoulder  of  Auriga,  and  therefore \ndeviated  from  the  opposition  of  the  sun  towards  the  north  by  an  angle  of \n10\u00b0. Lastly,  Feb. 10,  with  a  telescope  I  observed  the  tail  2\u00b0  long  ;  for  that \nfainter  light  which  I  spoke  of  did  not  appear  through  the  glasses. But \nPonthftiis  writes,  that,  on  Feb. 7,  lie  saw  the  tail  12\u00b0  lone:. Feb. 25,  the \nfjrnet  was  without  a  tail,  and  so  continued  till  it  disappeared", "THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III. Now  if  one  reflects  upon  the  orbit  described,  and  duly  considers  the  other \nappearances  of  this  comet,  he  will  be  easily  satisfied  that  the  bodies  of \ncomets  are  solid,  compact,  fixed,  and  durable,  like  the  bodies  of  the  planets ; \nfor  if  they  were  nothing  else  but  the  vapours  or  exhalations  of  the  earth,  of \nthe  sun,  and  other  planets,  this  comet,  in  its  passage  by  the  neighbourhood \nof  the  sun,  would  have  been  immediately  dissipated;  for  the  heat  of  the \nsun  is  as  the  density  of  its  rays,  that  is,  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the \ndistance  of  the  places  from  the  sun. Therefore,  since  on  Dec. 8,  when  the \ncomet  was  in  its  perihelion,  the  distance  thereof  from  the  centre  of  the  sun \nwas  to  the  distance  of  the  earth  from  the  same  as  about  6  to  1000;  the \nsun's  heat  on  the  comet  was  at  that  time  to  the  heat  of  the  summer-sun \nwith  us  as  1000000  to  36,  or  as  28000  to  1. But  the  heat  of  boiling \nwater  is  about  3  times  greater  than  the  heat  which  dry  earth  acquires  from \nthe  summer-sun,  as  I  have  tried :  and  the  heat  of  red-hot  iron  (if  my  con \njecture  is  right)  is  about  three  or  four  times  greater  than  the  heat  of  boil \ning  water.", "ture  is  right)  is  about  three  or  four  times  greater  than  the  heat  of  boil \ning  water. And  therefore  the  heat  which  dry  earth  on  the  comet,  while  in \nits  perihelion,  might  have  conceived  from  the  rays  of  the  sun,  was  about \n2000  times  greater  than  the  heat  of  red-hot  iron. But  by  so  fierce  a  heat, \nvapours  and  exhalations,  and  every  volatile  matter,  must  have  been  imme \ndiately  consumed  and  dissipated. This  comet,  therefore,  must  have  conceived  an  immense  heat  from  the \nsun,  and  retained  that  heat  for  an  exceeding  long-  time ;  for  a  globe  of  iron \nof  an  inch  in  diameter,  exposed  red-hot  to  the  open  air,  will  scarcely  lose \nall  its  heat  in  an  hour's  time;  but  a  greater  globe  would  retain  its  heat \nlonger  in  the  proportion  of  its  diameter,  because  the  surface  (in  proportion \nto  which  it  is  cooled  by  the  contact  of  the  ambient  air)  is  in  that  proportion \nless  in  respect  of  the  quantity  of  the  included  hot  matter;  and  therefore  a \nglobe  of  red  hot  iron  equal  to  our  earth,  that  is,  about  40000000  feet  in \ndiameter,  would  scarcely  cool  in  an  equal  number  of  days,  or  in  above \n50000  years.", "in \ndiameter,  would  scarcely  cool  in  an  equal  number  of  days,  or  in  above \n50000  years. But  I  suspect  that  the  duration  of  heat  may,  on  account  of \nsome  latent  causes,  increase  in  a  yet  less  proportion  than  that  of  the \ndiameter ;  and  I  should  be  glad  that  the  true  proportion  was  investigated \nby  experiments. It  is  farther  to  be  observed,  that  the  comet  in  the  month  of  December. just  after  it  had  been  heated  by  the  sun,  did  emit  a  much  longer  tail,  and \nmuch  more  splendid,  than  in  the  month  of  November  before,  when  it  had \nnot  yet  arrived  .it  its  perihelion;  and,  universally,  the  greatest  and  most \nfulgent  tails  always  arise  from  comets  immediately  ,  fter  their  passing  by \nthe  neighbourhood  of  the  sun. Therefore  the  heat  received  by  the  comet \nconduces  to  the  greatness  of  the  tail:  from  whence,  I  thiufc  I  may  infer, \nthat  the  tail  is  nothing  else  but  a  very  fine  vapour,  which  the  head  or \nnucleus  of  the  comet  emits  by  its  heat. Jbut  we  have  had  three  several  opinions  about  the  tails  of  comets;  for", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 48? some  will  have  it  that  they  are  nothing  else  but  the  beams  of  the  sun's \nlight  transmitted  through  the  comets'  heads,  which  they  suppose  to  be \ntransparent ;  others,  that  they  proceed  from  the  refraction  which  light  suf \nfers  in  passing  from  the  comet's  head  to  the  earth :  and,  lastly,  others,  thac \nthey  are  a  sort  of  clouds  or  vapour  constantly  rising  from  the  comets7  heads. and  tending  towards  the  parts  opposite  to  the  sun. The  first  is  the  opin \nion  of  such  as  are  yet  unacquainted  with  optics :  for  the  beams  of  the  sun \nare  seen  in  a  darkened  room  only  in  consequence  of  the  light  that  is  re \nflected  from  them  by  the  little  particles  of  dust  and  smoke  which  are \nalways  flying  about  in  the  air;  and,  for  that  reason,  in  air  impregnated \nwith  thick  smoke,  those  beams  appear  with  great  brightness,  and  move  the \nsense  vigorously  ;  in  a  yet  finer  air  they  appear  more  faint,  and  are  less \neasily  discerned  ;  but  in  the  heavens,  where  there  is  no  matter  to  reflect \nthe  light  they  can  never  be  seen  at  all.", "eavens,  where  there  is  no  matter  to  reflect \nthe  light  they  can  never  be  seen  at  all. Light  is  not  seen  as  it  is  in  the \nbeam,  but  as  it  is  thence  reflected  to  our  eyes  ;  for  vision  can  be  no  other \nwise  produced  than  by  rays  falling  upon  the  eyes  ;  and. therefore,  there \nmust  be  some  reflecting  matter  in  those  parts  where  the  tails  of  the  comets \nare  seen  :  for  otherwise,  since  all  the  celestial  spaces  are  equally  illumin \nated  by  the  sun's  light,  no  part  of  the  heavens  could  appear  with  more \nsplendor  than  another. The  second  opinion  is  liable  to  many  difficulties.", "pear  with  more \nsplendor  than  another. The  second  opinion  is  liable  to  many  difficulties. The  tails  of  comets  are  never  seen  variegated  with  those  colours  which \ncommonly  are  inseparable  from  refraction  ;  and  the  distinct  transmission \nof  the  light  of  the  fixed  stars  and  planets  to  us  is  a  demonstration  that \nthe  aether  or  celestial  medium  is  not  endowed  with  any  refractive  power  : \nfor  as  to  what  is  alleged,  that  the  fixed  stars  have  been  sometimes  seen  by \nthe  Egyptians  environed  with  a  Coma  or  Capit/itinm,  because  that  has \nbut  rarely  happened,  it  is  rather  to  be  ascribed  to' a  casual  refraction  of \nclouds;  and  so  the  radiation  and  scintillation  of  the  fixed  stars  to  tin \nrefractions  both  of  the  eyes  and  air  ;  for  upon  laying  a  telescope  to  the \neye,  those  radiations  and  scintillations  immediately  disappear.", "laying  a  telescope  to  the \neye,  those  radiations  and  scintillations  immediately  disappear. By  the  trem \nulous  agitation  of  the  air  and  ascending  vapours,  it  happens  that  the  rays  of \nlight  are  alternately  turned  aside  from  the  narrow  space  of  the  pupil  of  the \neye;  but  no  such  thing  can  have  place  in  the  much  wider  aperture  of  the  ob \nject-glass  of  a  telescope  ;  and  hence  it  is  that  a  scintillation  is  occasioned  ir, \nthe  former  case,  wrhich  ceases  in  the  latter  ;  and  this  cessation  in  the  latter \ncase  is  a  demonstration  of  the  regular  transmission  of  light  through  the \nheavens,  without  any  sensible  refraction. But,  to  obviate  an  objection \nthat  may  be  made  from  the  appearing  of  no  tail  in  such  comets  as  shine \nbut  with  a  faint  light,  as  if  the  secondary  rays  were  then  too  weak  to  af \nfect  the  eyes,  and  for  that  reason  it  is  that  the  tails  of  the  fixed  stars  do \nnot  appear,  we  are  to  consider,  that  by  the  means  of  telescopes  the  light  of \nthe  fixed  stars  may  be  augmented  above  an  hundred  fold,  and  yet  no  tails \nare  seen  ;  that  the  light  of  the  planets  is  yet  more  copious  without  any", "488  THE  MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES  [BOOK  111. tail ;  but  that  comets  are  seen  sometimes  with  huge  tails,  when  the  light \nof  their  heads  is  but  faint  and  dull. For  so  it  happened  in  the  comet  of \nthe  year  1680,  when  in  the  month  of  December  it  was  scarcely  equal  in \nlight  to  the  stars  of  the  second  magnitude,  and  yet  emitted  a  notable  tail, \nextending  to  the  length  of  40\u00b0,  50\u00b0,  60\u00b0,  or  703,  and  upwards ;  and  after \nwards,  on  the  27th  and  28th  of  January,  when  the  head  appeared  but  us \na  star  of  the  7th  magnitude,  yet  the  tail  (as  we  said  above),  with  a  light \nthat  was  sensible  enough,  though  faint,  was  stretched  out  to  6  or  7  degrees \nin  length,  and  with  a  languishing  light  that  was  more  difficultly  seen,  even \nto  .12\u00b0,  and  upwards. But  on  the  9th  and  10th  of  February,  when  to  the \nnaked  eye  the  head  appeared  no  more,  through  a  telescope  I  viewed  the \ntail  of  2\u00b0  in  length. But  farther;  if  the  tail  was  owing  to  the  refrac \ntion  of  the  celestial  matter,  and  did  deviate  from  the  opposition  of  the \nsun,  according  to  the  figure  of  the  heavens,  that  deviation  in  the  same \nplaces  of  the  heavens  should  be  always  directed  towards  the  same  parts.

And  the  cornet  of  the  year  1577,  December  29d. was  in  X  8\u00b0  41', \nwith  latitude  north  28  40',  and  the  sin,  as  before,  in  about  V^  18\u00b0  26'. In  both  cases  the  situation  of  the  earth  was  the  same,  and  the  comet  ap \npeared  in  the  same  place  of  the  heavens  ;  yet  in  the  former  case  the  tail \nof  the  comet  (as  well  by  my  observations  as  by  the  observations  of  others) \ndeviated  from  the  opposition  of  the  sun  towards  the  north  by  an  angle  of \n4|-  degrees  ;  whereas  in  the  latter  there  was  (according  to  the  observations \nof  Tychfi)  a  deviation  of  21  degrees  towards  the  south. The  refraction, \ntherefore,  of  the  heavens  being  thus  disproved,  it  remains  that  the  pha- \ntio'mena  of  the  tails  of  comets  must  be  derived  from  some  reflecting  matter. And  that  the  tails  of  comets  do  arise  from  their  heads,  and  tend  towards \nthe  parts  opposite  to  the  sun,  is. farther  confirmed  from  the  laws  which \nthe  tails  observe.", "parts  opposite  to  the  sun,  is. farther  confirmed  from  the  laws  which \nthe  tails  observe. As  that,  lying  in  the  planes  of  the  comets'  orbits \nwhich  pass  tl trough  the  sun,  they  constantly  deviate  from  the  opposition \nof  the  sun  towards  the  parts  which  the  comets'  heads  in  their  progress \nalong  these  orbits  have  left.

That  the  deviation,  cceteris  paribus,  appears  less  when \nthe  tail  is  more  oblique  to  the  orbit  of  the  comet,  as  well  as  when  the \nhead  of  the  comet  approaches  nearer  to  the  sun,  especially  if  the  angle  of \ndeviation  is  estimated  near  the  head  of  the  comet. That  the  tails  which \nhave  no  deviation  appear  straight,  but  the  tails  which  deviate  are  like \nwise  bended  into  a  certain  curvature. That  this  curvature  is  greater  when \nthe  deviation  is  greater ;  and  is  more  sensible  when  the  tail,  cceteris  pari- \nbus  is  longer  ;  for  in  the  shorter  tails  the  curvature  is  hardly  to  be  p-jr-", "HOOK   HI.]  or  NATURAL  PHILOSOPHY. 489 \nccived. That  the  angle  of  deviation  is  less  near  the  comet's  head,  but \ngreater  towards  the  other  end  of  the  tail ;  and  that  because  the  convex \nside  of  the  tail  regards  the  parts  from  which  the  deviation  is  made,  and \nwhich  lie  in  a  right  line  drawn  out  infinitely  from  the  sun  through  the \ncomet's  head. And  that  the  tails  that  are  long  and  broad,  and  shine  with \na  stronger  light,  appear  more  resplendent  and  more  exactly  defined  on  the \nconvex  than  on  the  concave  side. Upon  which  accounts  it  is  plain  that \nthe  phenomena  of  the  tails  of  comets  depend  upon  the  motions  of  their \nheads,  and  by  no  means  upon  the  places  of  the  heavens  in  which  their \nheads  are  seen  ;  and  that,  therefore,  the  tails  of  comets  do  not  proceed  from \nthe  refraction  of  the  heavens,  but  from  their  own  heads,  which  furnish  the \nmatter  that  forms  the  tail.", "the  heavens,  but  from  their  own  heads,  which  furnish  the \nmatter  that  forms  the  tail. For,  as  in  our  air,  the  smoke  of  a  heated  body \nascends  either  perpendicularly  if  the  body  is  at  rest,  or  obliquely  if  the \nbody  is  moved  obliquely,  so  in  the  heavens,  where  all  bodies  gravitate  to \nwards  the  sun,  smoke  and  vapour  must  (as  we  have  already  said)  ascend \nfrom  the  sun,  and  either  rise  perpendicularly  if  the  smoking  body  is  at \nrest,  or  obliquely  if  the  body,  in  all  the  progress  of  its  motion,  is  always \nleaving  those  places  from  which  the  upper  or  higher  parts  of  the  vapour \nhad  risen  before ;  and  that  obliquity  will  be  least  where  the  vapour  ascends \nwith  most  velocity,  to  wit,  near  the  smoking  body,  when  that  is  near  the \nsun. But,  because  the  obliquity  varies,  the  column  of  vapour  will  be  in- \ncurvated ;  and  because  the  vapour  in  the  preceding  sides  is  something  more \nrecent,  that  is,  has  ascended  something  more  late  from  the  body,  it  will \ntherefore  be  something  more  dense  on  that  side,  and  must  on  that  account \nreflect  more  light,  as  well  as  be  better  defined.", "that  side,  and  must  on  that  account \nreflect  more  light,  as  well  as  be  better  defined. I  add  nothing  concerning \nthe  sudden  uncertain  agitation  of  the  tails  of  comets,  and  their  irregular \nfigures,  which  authors  sometimes  describe,  because  they  may  arise  from  the \nmutations  of  our  air,  and  the  motions  of  our  clouds,  in  part  obscuring \nthose  tails ;  or,  perhaps,  from  parts  of  the  Via  Laclea,  which  might  have \nbeen  confounded  with  and  mistaken  for  parts  of  the  tails  of  the  comets  JIB \nthey  passed  by. But  that  the  atmospheres  of  comets  may  furnish  a  supply  of  vapour \ngreat  enough  to  fill  so  immense  spaces,  we  may  easily  understand  from  the \nrari  ty  of  our  own  air ;  for  the  air  near  the  surface  of  our  earth  possesses \na  space  850  times  greater  than  water  of  the  same  weight ;  arid  therefore \na  cylinder  of  air  850  feet  high  is  of  equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of  water \nof  the  same  breadth,  and  but  one  foot  high.", "of  equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of  water \nof  the  same  breadth,  and  but  one  foot  high. But  a  cylinder  of  air  reach \ning  to  the  top  of  the  atmosphere  is  of  equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of \nwater  about  33  feet  high  :  and,  therefore,  if  from  the  whole  cylinder  of \nair  the  lower  part  of  850  feet  high  is  taken  away,  the  remaining  upper \npart  will  be  of  equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of  water  32  feet  high  :  and \nfrom  thence  (and  by  the  hypothesis,  confirmed  by  many  experiments,  that \nthe  compression  of  air  is  as  the  weight  of  the  incumbent  atmosphere,  and", "400  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    III \nthat  the  force  of  gravity  is  reciprocally  as  the  square  of  the  distance  from \nthe  centre  of  the  earth)  raising  a  calculus,  by  Cor. Prop. XXII,  Book  II, \nI  found,  that,  at  the  height  of  one  semi-diameter  of  the  earth,  reckoned \nfrom  the  earth's  surface,  the  air  is  more  rare  than  with  us  in  u  far  greater \nproportion  than  of  the  whole  space  within  the  orb  of  Saturn  to  a  spherical \nspace  of  one  inch  in  diameter  ;  and  therefore  if  a  sphere  of  our  air  of  but \none  inch  in  thickness  was  equally  rarefied  with  the  air  at  the  height  of \none  semi-diameter  of  the  earth  from  the  earth's  surface,  it  would  rill  all \nthe  regions  of  the  planets  to  the  orb  of  Saturn,  and  far  beyond  it.", "would  rill  all \nthe  regions  of  the  planets  to  the  orb  of  Saturn,  and  far  beyond  it. Where \nfore  since  the  air  at  greater  distances  is  immensely  rarefied,  and  the  coma \nor  atmosphere  of  comets  is  ordinarily  about  ten  times  higher,  reckoning \nfrom  their  centres,  than  the  surface  of  the  nucleus,  and  the  tails  rise  yet \nhigher,  they  must  therefore  be  exceedingly  rare ;  and  though,  on  account \nof  the  much  thicker  atmospheres  of  comets,  and  the  great  gravitation  of \ntheir  bodies  towards  the  sun,  as  well  as  of  the  particles  of  their  air  and \nvapours  mutually  one  towards  another,  it  may  happen  that  the  air  in  the \ncelestial  spaces  and  in  the  tails  of  comets  is  not  so  vastly  rarefied,  yet \nfrom  this  computation  it  is  plain  that  a  very  small  quantity  of  air  and \nvapour  is  abundantly  sufficient  to  produce  all  the  appearances  of  the  tails \nof  comets  :  for  that  they  are,  indeed,  of  a  very  notable  rarity  appears  from \nthe  shining  of  the  stars  through  them.", "indeed,  of  a  very  notable  rarity  appears  from \nthe  shining  of  the  stars  through  them. The  atmosphere  of  the  earth, \nilluminated  by  the  sun's  light,  though  but  of  a  few  miles  in  thickness, \nquite  obscures  and  extinguishes  the  light  not  only  of  all  the  stars,  but \neven  of  the  moon  itself;  whereas  the  smallest  stars  are  seen  to  shine \nthrough  the  immense  thickness  of  the  tails  of  comets,  likewise  illuminated \nby  the  sun,  without  the  least  diminution  of  their  splendor. Nor  is  the \nbrightness  of  the  tails  of  most  comets  ordinarily  greater  than  that  of  our \nair,  an  inch  or  two  in  thickness,  reflecting  in  a  darkened  room  the  light  of \nthe  sun-beams  let  in  by  a  hole  of  the  window-shutter. And  we  may  pretty  nearly  determine  the  time  spent  during  the  ascent \nof  the  vapour  from  the  comet's  head  to  the  extremity  of  the  tail,  by  draw \ning  a  right  line  from  the  extremity  of  the  tail  to  the  sun,  and  marking \nthe  place  where  that  right  line  intersects  the  comet's  orbit :  for  the  vapour \nthat  is  now  in  the  extremity  of  the  tail,  if  it  has  ascended  in  a  right  line \nfrom  the  sun,  must  have  begun  to  rise  from  the  head  at  the  time  when  the \nhead  was  in  the  point  of  intersection.", "n  to  rise  from  the  head  at  the  time  when  the \nhead  was  in  the  point  of  intersection. It  is  true,  the  vapour  does  not  rise \nin  a  right  line  from  the  sun,  but,  retaining  the  motion  Avhich  it  had  from \nthe  comet  before  its  ascent,  and  compounding  that  motion  witli  its  motion \nof  ascent,  arises  obliquely  ;  and,  therefore,  the  solution  of  the  Problem  will \nbe  more  exact,  if  we  draw  the  line  which  intersects  the  orbit  parallel  to \nthe  length  of  the  tail ;  or  rather  (because  of  the  curvilinear  motion  of  the \ncomet)  diverging  a  little  from  the  line  or  length  of  the  tail. And  by \nmeans  of  this  principle  I  found  that  the  vapour  which,  Ja/iutiry  25,  was", "BOOK   III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 491 \nin  the  extremity  of  the  tail,  had  begun  to  rise  from  the  head  before  De \ncember  11,  and  therefore  had  spent  in  its  whole  ascent  45  days  ;  but  that \nthe  whole  tail  which  appeared  on  December  10  had  finished  its  ascent  in \nthe  space  of  the  two  days  then  elapsed  from  the  time  of  the  comet's  being \nin  its  perihelion. The  vapour,  therefore,  about  the  beginning  and  in  the \nneighbourhood  of  the  sun  rose  with  the  greatest  velocity,  and  afterwards \ncontinued  to  ascend  with  a  motion  constantly  retarded  by  its  own  gravity  ; \nand  the  higher  it  ascended,  the  more  it  added  to  the  length  of  the  tail ; \nand  while  the  tail  continued  to  be  seen,  it  was  made  up  of  almost  all  that \nvapour  which  had  risen  since  the  time  of  the  comet's  being  in  its  perihe \nlion  ;  nor  did  that  part  of  the  vapour  which  had  risen  first,  and  which \nfunned  the  extremity  of  the  tail,  cease  to  appear,  till  its  too  great  dis \ntance,  as  well  from  the  sun,  from  which  it  received  its  li^it,  as  from  our \neyes,  rendered  it  invisible.", "m  the  sun,  from  which  it  received  its  li^it,  as  from  our \neyes,  rendered  it  invisible. Whence  also  it  is  that  the  tails  of  other  comets \nwhich  are  short  do  riot  rise  from  their  heads  with  a  swift  and  continued \nmotion,  and  soon  after  disappear,  but  are  permanent  and  lasting  columns \nof  vapours  and  exhalations,  which,  ascending  from  the  heads  with  a  slow- \nmotion  of  many  days,  and  partaking  of  the  motion  of  the  heads  which \nthey  had  from  the  beginning,  continue  to  go  along  together  with  them \nthrough  the  heavens. From  whe-.ee  again  we  have  another  argument \nproving  the  celestial  spaces  to  be  free,  and  without  resistance,  since  in \nthem  not  only  the  solid  bodies  of  the  planets  and  comets,  but  also  the  ex \ntremely  rare  vapours  of  comets1  tails,  maintain  their  rapid  motions  with \ngreat  freedom,  and  for  an  exceeding  long  time.", "tails,  maintain  their  rapid  motions  with \ngreat  freedom,  and  for  an  exceeding  long  time. Kepler  ascribes  the  ascent  of  the  tails  of  the  comets  to  the  atmospheres \nof  their  heads :  and  their  direction  towards  the  parts  opposite  to  the  sun  to \nthe  action  of  the  rays  of  light  carrying  along  with  them  the  matter  of  the \ncomets'  tails ;  and  without  any  great  incongruity  we  may  suppose,  that,  in \nso  free  spaces,  so  fine  a  matter  as  that  of  the  aether  may  yield  to  the  action \nof  the  rays  of  the  sun's  light,  though  those  rays  are  not  able  sensibly  to \nmove  the  gross  substances  in  our  parts,  which  are  clogged  with  so  palpable \na  resistance.", "ve  the  gross  substances  in  our  parts,  which  are  clogged  with  so  palpable \na  resistance. Another  author  thinks  that  there  may  be  a  sort  of  particles \nof  matter  endowed  with  a  principle  of  levity,  as  well  as  others  are  with  a \npower  of  gravity ;  that  the  matter  of  the  tails  of  comets  may  be  of  the \nformer  sort,  and  that  its  ascent  from  the  sun  may  be  owing  to  its  levity ; \nbut,  considering  that  the  gravity  of  terrestrial  bodies  is  as  the  matter  of \nthe  bodies,  and  therefore  can  be  neither  more  nor  less  in  the  same  quantity \nof  matter,  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that  this  ascent  may  rather  proceed  from \nthe  rarefaction  of  the  matter  of  the  comets'  tails. The  ascent  of  smoke  in \na  chimney  is  owing  to  the  impulse  of  the  air  with  which  it  is  entangled. The  air  rarefied  by  heat  ascends,  because  its  specific  gravity  is  diminished, \nand  in  its  ascent  carries  along  with  it  the  smoke  with  which  it  is  engaged ; \nind  why  may  not  the  tail  of  a  comet  rise  from  the  sun  after  the  same  man-", "492  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PHINCIPLES  [BOOK    III. ner  ? For  the  sun's  rays  do  not  act  upon  the  mediums  which  they  per \nvade  otherwise  than  by  reflection  and  refraction  ;  and  those  reflecting  par \nticles  heated  by  this  action,  heat  the  matter  of  the  aether  which  is  involved \nwith  them. That  matter  is  rarefied  by  the  heat  which  it  acquires,  and  be- \noause,  by  this  rarefaction,  the  specific  gravity  with  which  it  tended  towards \nthe  sun  before  is  diminished,  it  will  ascend  therefrom,  and  carry  along  with \nit  the  reflecting  particles  of  which  the  tail  of  the  comet  is  composed. But \nthe  ascent  of  the  vapours  is  further  promoted  by  their  circumgyration \nabout  the  sun,  in  consequence  whereof  they  endeavour  to  recede  from  the \nsun,  while  the  sun's  atmosphere  and  the  other  matter  of  the  heavens  are \neither  altogether  quiescent,  or  are  only  moved  with  a  slower  circumgyra \ntion  derived  from  the  rotation  of  the  sun.", "or  are  only  moved  with  a  slower  circumgyra \ntion  derived  from  the  rotation  of  the  sun. And  these  are  the  causes  of  the \nascent  of  the  tails  of  the  comets  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  sun,  where \ntheir  orbits  are  bent  into  a  greater  curvature,  and  the  comets  themselves \nare  plunged  into  the  denser  and  therefore  heavier  parts  of  the  sun's  atmos \nphere  :  upon  which  account  they  do  then  emit  tails  of  an  huge  length ;  for \nthe  tails  which  then  arise,  retaining  their  own  proper  motion,  and  in  the \nmean  time  gravitating  towards  the  sun,  must  be  revolved  in  ellipses  about \nthe  sun  in  like  manner  as  the  heads  are,  and  by  that  motion  must  always \naccompany  the  heads,  and  freely  adhere  to  them. For  the  gravitation  ot \nthe  vapours  towards  the  sun  can  no  more  force  the  tails  to  abandon  the \nheads,  and  descend  to  the  sun,*than  the  gravitation  of  the  heads  can  oblige \nthem  to  fall  from  the  tails.", "to  the  sun,*than  the  gravitation  of  the  heads  can  oblige \nthem  to  fall  from  the  tails.

The  tails,  therefore,  that  rise  in  the  perihelion  positions  of  the  comets \nwill  go  along  with  their  heads  into  far  remote  parts,  and  together  with \nthe  heads  will  either  return  again  from  thence  to  us,  after  a  long  course  of \nyears,  or  rather  will  be  there  rarefied,  and  by  degrees  quite  vanish  away ; \nfor  afterwards,  in  the  descent  of  the  heads  towards  the  sun,  new  short  tails \nwill  be  emitted  from  the  heads  with  a  slow  motion;  and  those  tails  by  de \ngrees  will  be  augmented  immensely,  especially  in  such  comets  as  in  their \nperihelion  distances  descend  as  low  as  the  sun's  atmosphere ;  for  all  vapour \nin  those  free  spaces  is  in  a  perpetual  state  of  rarefaction  and  dilatation ; \nand  from  hence  it  is  that  the  tails  of  all  comets  are  broader  at  their  upper \nextremity  than  near  their  heads.", "t  the  tails  of  all  comets  are  broader  at  their  upper \nextremity  than  near  their  heads.

I  suspect,  moreover,  that  it  is  chiefly  from  the \ncomets  that  spirit  comes,  which  is  indeed  the  smalles;  but  the  most  subtle \nand  useful  part  of  our  air,  arid  so  much  required  to  sustain  the  life  of  all \nthings  with  us. The  atmospheres  of  comets,  in  their  descent  towards  the  sun,  by  running \nout  into  the  tails,  are  spent  and  diminished,  and  become  narrower,  at  least \non  that  side  which  regards  the  sun ;  and  in  receding  from  the  sun,  when \nthey  less  run  out  into  the  tails,  they  are  again  enlarged,  if  Hevelins  has \njustly  marked  their  appearances. But  they  are  seen  least  of  all  just  after \nthey  have  been  most  heated  by  the  sun,  and  on  that  account  then  emit  the \nlongest  and  most  resplendent  tails;  and,  perhaps,  at  the  same  time,  the \nnuclei  are  environed  with  a  denser  and  blacker  smoke  in  the  lowermost \nparts  of  their  atmosphere ;  for  smoke  that  is  raised  by  a  great  and  intense \nheat  is  commonly  the  denser  and  blacker.", "smoke  that  is  raised  by  a  great  and  intense \nheat  is  commonly  the  denser  and  blacker. Thus  the  head  of  that  cornet \nwhich  we  have  been  describing,  at  equal  distances  both  from  the  sun  and \nfrom  the  earth,  appeared  darker  after  it  had  passed  by  its  perihelion  than \nit  did  before ;  for  in  the  month  of  December  it  was  commonly  compared \nwith  the  stars  of  the  third  magnitude,  but  in  November  with  those  of  the \nfirst  or  second ;  and  such  as  saw  both  appearances  have  described  the  first \nas  of  another  and  greater  comet  than  the  second. For,  November  19. this \ncomet  appeared  to  a  young  man  at  Cambridge,  though  with  a  pale  and \ndull  light,  yet  equal  to  Spica  Virg-inis ;  and  at  that  time  it  shone  with \ngreater  brightness  than  it  did  afterwards.

And,  which  farther  makes  for  the  same  purpose,  I  find,  that  the  heads  of \nother  cornets,  which  did  put  forth  tails  of  the  greatest  bulk  and  splendor, \nhave  appeared  but  obscure  and  small. For  in  Brazil,  March  5,  1 668,  7h. P. M.;  St. N. P. Valentin  its  Esta.'tcws  saw  a  comet  near  the  horizon,  and \ntowards  the  south  west,  with  a  head  so  small  as  scarcely  to  be  discerned, \nbut  with  a  tail  above  measure  splendid,  so  that  the  reflection  thereof  from \nthe  sea  was  easily  seen  by  those  who  stood  upon  the  shore ;  and  it  looked \nlike  a  fiery  beam  extended  23\u00b0  in  length  from  the  west  to  south,  almost \nparallel  to  the  horizon.", "y  beam  extended  23\u00b0  in  length  from  the  west  to  south,  almost \nparallel  to  the  horizon. But  this  excessive  splendor  continued  only  three \ndays,  decreasing  apace  afterwards ;  arid  while  the  splendor  was  decreasing, \nthe  bulk  of  the  tail  increased  :  whence  in  Portugal  it  is  said  to  have  taken \nap  one  quarter  of  the  heavens,  that  is,  45  degrees,  extending  from  west  to \n3ast  with  a  very  notable  splendor,  though  the  whole  tail  was  not  seen  in \nthose  parts,  becar.sc  the  head  was  always  hid  under  the  horizon :  and  from \nthe  increase  of  the  hulk  arid  decrease  of  the  splendor  of  the  tail,  it  appears \nthat  the  head  vis  then  in  its  recess  from  the  sun,  and  had  been  very  near \nto  it  in  its  perihelion,  as  the  comet  of  1680  was. And  we  read,  in  the \nSaxon  Chronicle,  of  a  like  comet  appearing  in  the  year  1 106,  the  star \nwhereof  was  small  and  obscure  (as  that  of  1680),  but  the  splendour  of  its \ntail  w^s  very  bright,  and  like  a  huge  fiery  beam  stretched  out  in  a  direc \ntion  fetween  the  east  and  north,  as  Hevelius  has  it  also  from  Simeon,  the \nmonk  of  Durham. This  comet  appeared  in  the  beginning  of  February.", "also  from  Simeon,  the \nmonk  of  Durham. This  comet  appeared  in  the  beginning  of  February. about  the  evening,  and  towards  the  south  west  part  of  heaven ;  frc-in \nwhence,  and  from  the  position  of  the  tail,  we  infer  that  the  head  was  near \nthe  sun. Matthew  Paris  says,  //  was  distant  from  the  sun  by  about  a \ncubit,  from,  three  of  the  clock  (rather  six)  till  nine,  putting  forth  a  long \ntail. Such  also  was  that  most  resplendent  comet  described  by  Aristotle, \nlib. 1,  Meteor. 6. The  head  whereof  could  not  be  seen,  because  it  had  set \nbefore  the  sun,  or  at  least  was  hid  under  the  sun's  rays  ;  but  next  day \nit  was  seen,  as  well  as  might  be  ;  for,  having  left  the  sun  but  a  very  lit \ntle  way,  it  set  immediately  after  it. And  the  scattered  light  of  the  head, \nobscured  by  the  too  great  splendour  (of  the  tail)  did  not  yet  appear. But \nafterwards  (as  Aristotle  says)  when  the  splendour  (of  the  tail)  was  now \ndiminished  (the  head  of),  the  comet  recovered  its  native  brightness  ;  and \nthe  splendour  (of  its  tail)  reached  now  to  a  third  part  of  the  heavens  (that \nis,  to  60\u00b0). This  appearance  was  in  the  winter  season  (an. 4,  Olymp. 101),  and,  rising  tit  Orion's  girdle,  it  there  vanished  away.", "nter  season  (an. 4,  Olymp. 101),  and,  rising  tit  Orion's  girdle,  it  there  vanished  away. It  is  true \nthat  the  comet  of  1618,  which  came  out  directly  from  under  the  sun's  rays \nwith  a  very  large  tail,  seemed  to  equal,  if  not  to  exceed,  the  stars  of  the \nfirst  magnitude:  but,  then,  abundance  of  other  comets  have  appeared  yet \ngreater  than  this,  that  put  forth  shorter  tails;  some  of  which  are  said", "BOOK    III.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 495 \nto  have  appeared  as  big  as  Jupiter,  others  as  big  as  Venus,  or  even  as \nthe  moon. We  have  said,  that  comets  are  a  sort  of  planets  revolved  in  very  eccen \ntric  orbits  about  the  sun :  and  as,  in  the  planets  which  are  without  tails, \nthose  are  commonly  less  which  are  revolved  in  lesser  orbits,  and  nearer  to \nthe  sun,  so  in  comets  it  is  probable  that  those  which  in  their  perihelion  ap \nproach  nearer  to  the  sun  ate  generally  of  less  magnitude,  that  they  may \nnot  agitate  the  sun  too  much  by  their  attractions. But,  as  to  the  trans \nverse  diameters  of  their  orbits,  and  the  periodic  times  of  their  revolutions, \n1  leave  them  to  be  determined  by  comparing  comets  together  ^hich  after \nlong  intervals  of  time  return  again  in  the  same  orbit. In  the  mean  time, \nthe  following  Proposition  may  give  some  light  in  that  inquiry. PROPOSITION  XLIL     PROBLEM  XXII. To  correct  a  cornet's  trajectory  found  as  above.

Assume  that  position  of  the  plane  of  the  trajectory  which \nwas  determined  according  to  the  preceding  proposition;  and  select  three \nplaces  of  the  comet,  deduced  from  very  accurate  observations,  and  at  great \ndistances  one  from  the  other.", "et,  deduced  from  very  accurate  observations,  and  at  great \ndistances  one  from  the  other. Then  suppose  A  to  represent  the  time  be \ntween  the  first  observation  and  the  second,  and  B  the  time  between  the \nsecoi.d  and  the  third ;  but  it  will  be  convenient  that  in  one  of  those  times \nthe  comet  be  in  its  perigeon,  or  at  least  not  far  from  it. From  those  ap \nparent  places  find,  by  trigonometric  operations,  the  three  true  places  of  the \ncomet  in  that  assumed  plane  of  the  trajectory ;  then  through  the  places \nfound,  and  about  the  centre  of  the  sun  as  the  focus,  describe  a  conic  section \nby  arithmetical  operations,  according  to  Prop. XXL,  Book  1.

Then  from  the  aforesaid  three  observed  places  of  the  comet  let  the  three \ntrue  places  be  found  (as  before)  in  this  new  plane;  as  also  the  orbit  passing \nthrough  those  places,  and  the  two  areas  of  the  same  described  between  the \ntwo  observations,  which  call  d  and  e  ;  and  let  t  be  the  whole  time  in  which \nthe  whole  area  d  +  e  should  be  described. OrER. 3. Retaining  the  longitude  of  the  nodes  in  the  first  operation,  let \nthe  inclination  of  the  plane  of  the  trajectory  to  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic  be \nincreased  by  adding  thereto  20'  or  30',  which  call  Q,. Then  from  the", "496  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    111 \naforesaid  three  observed  apparent  places  of  the  comet  let  the  three  true \nplaces  be  found  in  this  new  plane,  as  well  as  the  orbit  passing  through \nthem,  and  the  two  areas  of  the  same  described  between  the  observation, \nwhich  call  d  and  \u00a3 ;  and  let  r  be  the  whole  time  in  which  the  whole  area \n(5  -4-  \u00a3  should  be  described.

But  the  periodic  times  of  the  revolutions  of  comets,  and \nthe  transverse  diameters  of  their  orbits,  cannot  be  accurately  enough  de \ntermined  but  by  comparing  comets  together  which  appear  at  different \ntimes. If,  after  equal  intervals  of  time,  several  comets  are  found  to  have \ndescribed  the  same  orbit,  we  may  thence  conclude  that  they  are  all  but  one \nand  the  same  comet  revolved  in  the  same  orbit ;  and  then  from  the  times \nof  their  revolutions  the  transverse  diameters  of  their  orbits  will  be  given, \nand  from  those  diameters  the  elliptic  orbits  themselves  will  be  determined.", "l  be  given, \nand  from  those  diameters  the  elliptic  orbits  themselves  will  be  determined. To  this  purpose  the  trajectories  of  many  comets  ought  to  be  computed, \nsupposing  those  trajectories  to  be  parabolic;  for  such  trajectories  will \nalways  nearly  agree  with  the  ph&nomena,  as  appears  not  only  from  the \nparabolic  trajectory  of  the  comet  of  the  year  1680,  which  I  compared \nabove  with  the  observations,  but  likewise  from  that  of  the  notable  comet \nwhich  appeared  in  the  year  1664  and  1665,  and  was  observed  by  Hevelins, \nwho,  from  his  own  observations,  calculated  the  longitudes  and  latitudes \nthereof,  though  with  little  accuracy.

That  retrograde  comet  which  appeared  in  the  year  1607  described  an \norbit  whose  ascending;  node  (according  to  Dr. Halley's  computation)  was  in \nb  20\u00b0  2V ;  arid  the  inclination  of  the  plane  of  the  orbit  to  the  plane  of \nthe  ecliptic  17\u00b0  2';,  whose  perihelion  was  in  ox  2\u00b0  16';  and  its  perihelion \ndistance  from  the  sun  58680  of  such  parts  as  the  radius  of  the  orbis  mag-- \nnns  contains  100000;  and  the  comet  was  in  its  perihelion  October  16(l. 3\". 50' :  which  orbit  agrees  very  nearly  with  the  orbit  of  the  comet  which  WHS \nseen  in  1682.", ":  which  orbit  agrees  very  nearly  with  the  orbit  of  the  comet  which  WHS \nseen  in  1682. If  these  were  not  two  cliiferent  comets,  but  one  and  the \nsame,  that  comet  will  finish  one  revolution  in  the  space  of  75  years ;  and \nthe  greater  axis  of  its  orbit  will  be  to  the  greater  axis  of  the  nrbis  magims \nas  v/3  \u2022'  75  X  75  to  1,  or  as  1778  to  100,  nearly. And  the  aphelion  dis \ntance  of  this  comet  from  the  sun  will  be  to  the  mean  distance  of  the  earth \nfrom  the  sun  as  about  35  to  1 ;  from  which  data  it  will  be  no  hard  matter \nto  determine  the  elliptic  orbit  of  this  comet. But  these  things  are  to  be \nsupposed  on  condition,  that,  after  the  space  of  75  years,  the  same  comet \nshall  return  again  in  the  same  orbit. The  other  comets  seem  to  ascend  to \ngreater  heights,  and  to  require  a  longer  time  to  perform  their  revolutions. But. because  of  the  great  number  of  comets,  of  the  great  distance  of  their", "502  THE    MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES  [BOOK    IIL \naphelions  from  the  sun,  and  of  the  slowness  of  their  motions  in  the  aphe \nlions,  they  will,  by  their  mutual  gravitations,  disturb  each  other ;  so  that \ntheir  eccentricities  arid  the  times  of  their  revolutions  will  be  sometimes  a \nlittle  increased,  and  sometimes  diminished. Therefore  we  are  not  to  ex \npect  that  the  same  comet  will  return  exactly  in  the  same  orbit,  and  in  the \nsame  periodic  times :  it  will  be  sufficient  if  we  find  the  changes  no  greater \nthan  may  arise  from  the  causes  just  spoken  of. And  hense  a  reason  may  be  assigned  why  comets  are  not  comprehend-ed \nwithin  the  limits  of  a  zodiac,  as  the  planets  are;  but,  being  confined  to  no \nbounds,  are  with  various  motions  dispersed  all  over  the  heavens;  namely, \nto  this  purpose,  that  in  their  aphelions,  where  their  motions  are  exceedingly \nslow,  receding  to  greater  distances  one  from  another,  they  may  suffer  less \ndisturbance  from  their  mutual  gravitations:  and  hence  it  is  that  the  comets \nwhich  descend  the  lowest,  and  therefore  move  the  slowest  in  their  aphelions, \nought  also  to  ascend  the  highest.", ",  and  therefore  move  the  slowest  in  their  aphelions, \nought  also  to  ascend  the  highest. The  comet  which  appeared  in  the  year  1GSO  was  in  its  perihelion  less \ndistant  from  the  sun  than  by  a  sixth  part  of  the  sun's  diameter;  and  be \ncause  of  its  extreme  velocity  in  that  proximity  to  the  sun,  and  some  density \nof  the  sun's  atmosphere,  it  must  have  suffered  some  resistance  and  retarda \ntion ;  and  therefore,  being  attracted  something  nearer  to  the  sun  in  ev\u00abry \nrevolution,  will  at  last  fall  down  upon  the  body  of  the  sun. Nay. in  its \naphelion,  where  it  moves  the  slowest,  it  may  sometimes  happen  to  be  yet \nfarther  retarded  by  the  attractions  of  other  comets,  and  in  consequence  of \nthis  retardation  descend  to  the  sun. So  fixed  stars,  that  have  been  gradu \nally  wasted  by  the  light  and  vapours  emitted  from  them  for  a  long  time, \nmay  be  recruited  by  comets  that  fall  upon  them ;  and  from  tlrs  fresh  sup \nply  of  new  fuel  those  old  stars,  acquiring  new  splendor,  may  pass  for  new \nstars. Of  this  kind  are  such  fixed  stars  as  appear  on  a  sudden,  and  shine \nwith  a  wonderful  brightness  at  first,  and  afterwards  vanish  by  little  and \nlittle.", "shine \nwith  a  wonderful  brightness  at  first,  and  afterwards  vanish  by  little  and \nlittle. Such  was  that  star  which  appeared  in  Cassiopeia's  chair ;  which \nCornelius  Gemma  did  not  see  upon  the  8th  of  November,  1572,  though \nhe  was  observing  that  part  of  the  heavens  upon  that  very  night,  and  the \nsky  was  perfectly  serene;  but  the  next  night  (November  9)  he  saw  it \nshining  much  brighter  than  any  of  the  fixed  stars,  and  scarcely  inferior  to \nVenus  in  splendor. Tycho  Brake  saw  it  upon  the  llth  of  the  same  month, \nwhen  it  shone  with  the  greatest  lustre;  and  from  that  time  he  observed  it \nto  decay  by  little  and  little ;  and  in  16  months'  time  it  entirely  disap \npeared. In  the  month  of  November,  when  it  first  appeared,  its  light  was \nequal  to  that  of  Venus. In  the  month  of  December  its  light  was  a  littie \ndiminished,  and  was  now  become  equal  to  that  of  Jupiter. In  January \n1573  it  was  less  than  Jupiter,  and  greater  than  Siriits ;  and  about  the \nend  of  February  and  the  beginning  of  March  became  equal  to  that  star. In  the  months  of  April  and  May  it  was  equal  to  a  star  of  the  second  mag-", "HI.]  OF    NATURAL    PHILOSOPHY. 503 \nuitude;  in  June,  July,  and  August,  to  a  star  of  the  third  magnitude;  in \nSeptember,  October,  and  November,  to  those  of  the  fourth  magnitude;  in \nDecember  and  January  1574  to  those  of  the  fifth ;  in  February  to  those \nof  the  sixth  magnitude;  and  in  March  it  entirely  vanished. Its  colour  at \nthe  beginning  was  clear,  bright,  and  inclining  to  white;  afterwards  il \nturned  a  little  yellow;  and  in  March  1573  it  became  ruddy,  like  Mars  or \nAlclebaran :  in  May  it  turned  to  a  kind  of  dusky  whiteness,  like  that  we \nobserve  in  Saturn  ;  and  that  colour  it  retained  ever  after,  but  growing  al \nways  more  and  more  obscure. Such  also  was  the  star  in  the  right  foot  oi \nSerpentarius,  which  Kepler's  scholars  first  observed  September  30,  O.S. 1604,  with  a  light  exceeding  that  of  Jupiter,  though  the  night  before  it \nwas  not  to  be  seen;  and  from  that  time  it  decreased  by  little  and  little, \nand  in  15  or  16  months  entirely  disappeared.

If  the  earth  is  supposed  to  stand  still,  and  the  fixed  stars  to  be  revolved \nin  free  spaces  in  the  space  of  24  hours,  it  is  certain  the  forces  by  which \nthe  fixed  stars  are  retained  in  their  orbs  are  not  directed  to  the  earth,  but \nto  the  centres  of  the  several  orbs,  that  is,  of  the  several  parallel  circles, \nwhich  the  fixed  stars,  declining  to  one  side  and  the  other  from  the  equator, \ndescribe  daily  ;  also  that  by  radii  drawn  to  the  centres  of  those  orbs  tht \nfixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  of  description. Then,  because  the  periodic  times  are  equal  (by  Cor. Ill,  Prop. IV,  Book  1), \nit  follows  that  the  centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of  the  several  orbs, \nand  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the  same  orbs. And  the  like \nconsequences  may  be  drawn  from  the  supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the \nplanets. That  forces  should  be  directed  to  no  body  on  which  they  physically  de \npend,  but  to  innumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an \nhypothesis  too  incongruous.", "nnumerable  imaginary  points  in  the  axis  of  the  earth,  is  an \nhypothesis  too  incongruous. It  is  more  incongruous  still  that  those  forces \nshould  increase  exactly  in  proportion  of  the  distances  from  this  axis ;  for", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 515 \nthis  is  an  indi  ation  of  an  increase  to  immensity,  or  rather  to  infinity  ; \nwhereas  the  forces  of  natural  things  commonly  decrease  in  receding  from \nthe  fountain  from  which  they  flow. But,  what  is  yet  more  absurd,  neither \nare  the  areas  described  by  the  same  star  proportional  to  the  times,  nor  are \nits  revolutions  performed  in  the  same  orb  ;  for  as  the  star  recedes  from  the \nneighbouring  pole,  both  areas  and  orb  increase;  and  from  the  increase  of \nthe  urea  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  forces  are  not  directed  to  the  axis  of \nthe  earth. And  this  difficulty  (Cor. 1,  Prop. II)  arises  from  the  twofold \nmotion  that  is  observed  in  the  fixed  stars,  one  diurnal  round  the  axis  of \nthe  earth,  the  other  exceedingly  slow  round  the  axis  of  the  ecliptic. And \nthe  explication  thereof  requires  a  composition  of  forces  so  perplexed  and \nso  variable,  that  it  is  hardly  to  be  reconciled  with  any  physical  theory. That  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  to  the  bodies  of  the \nsun,  of  the  earth,  and  other  planets,  I  thus  infer. The  moon  revolves  about  our  earth,  and  by  radii  drawn  to  its  centre \n(p.", "I  thus  infer. The  moon  revolves  about  our  earth,  and  by  radii  drawn  to  its  centre \n(p. 390)  describes  areas  nearly  proportional  to  the  times  in  which  they  are \ndescribed,  as  is  evident  from  its  velocity  compared  with  its  apparent  diame \nter  ;  for  its  motion  is  slower  when  its  diameter  is  less  (and  therefore  its \ndistance  greater),  and  its  motion  is  swifter  when  its  diameter  is  greater. The  revolutions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  about  that  planet  are  more \nregular  (p. 386) :  for  they  describe  circles  concentric  with  Jupiter  by  equa \nble  motions,  as  exactly  as  our  senses  can  distinguish. And  so  the  satellites  of  Saturn  are  revolved  about  this  planet  with  mo \ntions  nearly  (p. 387)  circular  and  equable,  scarcely  disturbed  by  any  eccen \ntricity  hitherto  observed.

And  Venus,  with  a  motion  almost  uniform,  describes  an  orb  nearly  cir \ncular  and  concentric  with  the  sun. But  Mercury,  with  a  more  eccentric  motion,  makes  remarkable  ap \nproaches  to  the  sun,  and  goes  off  again  by  turns ;  but  it  is  always  swifter \nas  it  is  near  to  the  sun,  and  therefore  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun  still \ndescribes  areas  proportional  to  the  times. Lastly,  that  the  earth  describes  about  the  sun,  or  the  sun  about  the \nearth,  by  a  radius  from  the  one  to  the  other,  areas  exactly  proportional  to \nthe  times,  is  demonstrable  from  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  sun  com \npared  with  its  apparent  motion.

And  as  it  encompasses  the  sun  at  almost  equal  dist  n- \nces,  but  in  respect  of  the  earth  is  very  unequally  distant,  so  by  radii  drawn \nto  the  sun  it  describes  areas  nearly  uniform  ;  but  by  radii  drawn  to  the \nearth,  it  is  sometimes  swift,  sometimes  stationary,  and  sometimes  retrograde.

For  if  Jupiter  was  viewed  from  the  sun,  it  would  never  appear  retro \ngrade  nor  stationary,  as  it  is  seen  sometimes  from  the  earth,  but  always  to \ngo  forward  with  a  motion  nearly  uniform  (p. 389). And  from  the  very \ngreat  inequality  of  its  apparent  geocentric  motion,  we  infer  (by  Prop. Ill \nCor. IV)  that  the  force  by  which  Jupiter  is  turned  out  of  a  rectilinear  course, \nand  made  to  revolve  in  an  orb,  is  not  directed  to  the  centre  of  the  earth. And  the  same  argument  holds  good  in  Mars  and  in  Saturn. Another  centre \nof  these  forces  is  therefore  to  be  looked  for  (by  Prop. II  and  III,  and  the \nCorollaries  of  the  latter),  about  which  the  areas  described  by  radii  inter \nvening  may  be  equable ;  and  that  this  is  the  sun,  we  have  proved  already \nin  Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in  Jupiter. It  may  be \nalledged  that  the  sun  and  planets  are  impelled  by  some  other  force  equally \nand  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.", "force  equally \nand  in  the  direction  of  parallel  lines ;  but  by  such  a  force  (by  Cor.

And  thus  we  shall  always  find  the  said  propor \ntion  to  hold  exactly;  for  the  distances  of  Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  the  Earth, \nVenus,  and  Mercury,  from  the  sun,  drawn  from  the  observations  of  as \ntronomers,  are,  according  to  the  computation  of  Kepler,  as  the  numbers \n95  LOGO,  519650,  152350,  100000,  72400,  3S806;  by  the  computation  of \n/iHllialdus,  as  the  numbers  95419S,  522520,  152350,  100000,  72393, \n38585  ;  and  from  the  periodic  times  they  come  out  953806,  520116,  152399, \n100000,  72333,  38710. Their  distances,  according  to  Kepler  and \nKtillwldus,  scarcely  differ  by  any  sensible  quantity,  and  where  they \ndiffer  most  the  distances  drawn  from  the  periodic  times,  fall  in  between  them. That  the  circum-terrestrial  force  likewise  decreases  in  the  duplicate  pro \nportion  of  the  distances,  I  infer  thus. The  mean  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  centre  of  the  earth,  is,  in  semi- \ndiameters  of  the  earth,  according  to  Ptolemy,  Kepler  in  his  Ephemerides, \nBidliuldus,  Hevelius,  and  Ricciolns,  59 ;  according  to  Flamsted,  59|  ; \naccording  to  Tycho,  56 1 ;  to  Vendelin,  60  ;  to  Copernicus,  60 1 :  to  Kir- \ncher,  62i  (p. 391,  392,  393).", "56 1 ;  to  Vendelin,  60  ;  to  Copernicus,  60 1 :  to  Kir- \ncher,  62i  (p. 391,  392,  393). Cut  Tycho,  and  all  that  follow  his  tables  of  refraction,  making  the \nrefractions  of  the  sun  and  moon  (altogether  against  the  nature  of  light) \nto  exceed  those  of  the  fixed  stars,  and  that  by  about  four  or  five  minutes \nin  the  horizon,  did  thereby  augment  the  horizontal  parallax  of  the  moon \nby  about  the  like  number  of  minutes  ;  that  is,  by  about  the  12th  or  15th \npart  of  the  whole  parallax. Correct  this  error,  and  the  distance  will  be \ncome  60  or  61  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  nearly  agreeing  with  what \nothers  have  determined. Let  us,  then,  assume  the  mean  distance  of  the  moon  60  semi-diameters \nof  the  earth,  and  its  periodic  time  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars  27d. 7h. 43', \nas  astronomers  have  determined  it.

This  we  infer  by  a  calculus  formed  upon  Prop. XXXYI,  and  it  agrees \nwith  what  we  observe  in  all  bodies  about  the  earth. For  by  the  experi \nments  of  pendulums,  and  a  computation  raised  thereon,  Mr. Hnygens  has \ndemonstrated  that  bodies  falling  by  all  that  centripetal  force  with  which \n(of  whatever  nature  it  is)  they  are  impelled  near  the  surface  of  the  earth, \ndo,  in  one  second  of  time,  describe  15T^  Paris  feet. But  if  the  earth  is  supposed  to  move,  the  earth  and  moon  together  (by \nCor. IV  of  the  Laws  of  Motion,  and  Prop.

LX)  will  in \nthe  same  periodic  time,  27'1. 7h. 43',  with  the  same  circum  terrestrial  force \ndiminished  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance,  describe  an  orbit \nwhose  semi-diameter  is  to  the  semi-diameter  of  the  former  orbit,  that  is,  to \n60  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  as  the  sum  of  both  the  bodies  of  the  earth \nand  moon  to  the  first  of  two  mean  proportionals  between  this  sum  and  the \nbody  of  the  earth  ;  that  is,  if  we  suppose  the  moon  (on  account  of  its \nmean  apparent  diameter  31^')  to  be  about  ^  of  the  earth,  as  43  to \n^  42  a-  43|2,  or  as  about  128  to  127. And  therefore  the  semi-diameter \nof  the  orbit,  that  is,  the  distance  between  the  centres  of  the  moon  and \nearth,  will  in  this  case  be  60^  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  almost  the  same \nwith  that  assigned  by  Copernicus,  which  the  Tychonic  observations  by  no \nmeans  disprove  ;  and,  therefore,  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  decrement \nof  the  force  holds  good  in  this  distance. I  have  neglected  the  increment \nof  the  orbit  which  arises  from  the  action  of  the  sun  as  inconsiderable ; \nbut  if  that  is  subducted,  the  true  distance  will  remain  about  60|-  semi- \ndiameters  of  the  earth.", "t  is  subducted,  the  true  distance  will  remain  about  60|-  semi- \ndiameters  of  the  earth. But  farther  (p. 390) ;  this  proportion  of  the  decrement  of  the  forces  is \nconfirmed  from  the  eccentricity  of  the  planets,  and  the  very  slow  motion \nof  their  apses ;  for  (by  the  Corollaries  of  Prop. XLV)  in  no  other  pro- \nportion  could  the  circum-solar  planets  once  in  every  revolution  descend  to \ntheir  least  and  once  ascend  to  their  greatest  distance  from  the  sun,  and  the \nplaces  of  those  distances  remain  immoveable. A  small  error  from  the  du \nplicate  proportion  would  produce  a  motion  of  the  apses  considerable  in \nevery  revolution,  but  in  many  enormous. But  now,  after  innumerable  revolutions,  hardly  any  such  motion  ha& \nbeen  perceived  in  the  orbs  of  the  circum-solar  planets. Some  astronomers \naffirm  that  there  is  no  such  motion;  others  reckon  it  no  greater  than  what \nmay  easily  arise  from  the  causes  hereafter  to  be  assigned,  and  is  of  no  mo\u00ab \nment  in  the  present  question.", "THE    SYSTEM    01     THE    WORLD. 521 \nWe  may  even  neglect  the  motion  of  the  moon's  apsis  (p. 390,  391),  which \nis  far  greater  than  in  the  circum-solar  planets,  amounting  in  every  revolu \ntion  to  three  degrees ;  and  from  this  motion  it  is  demonstrable  that  the \ncircum-terrestrial  force  decreases  in  no  less  than  the  duplicate,  but  far  less \nthan  the  triplicate  proportion  of  the  distance ;  for  if  the  duplicate  propor \ntion  was  gradually  changed  into  the  triplicate,  the  motion  of  the  apsis \nwould  thereby  increase  to  infinity;  and,  therefore,  by  a  very  small  muta \ntion,  would  exceed  the  motion  of  the  moon's  apsis. This  slow  motion  arises \nfrom  the  action  of  the  circum-solar  force,  as  we  shall  afterwards  explain. But,  secluding  this  cause,  the  apsis  or  apogeon  of  the  moon  will  be  fixed, \nand  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  decrease  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force \nin  different  distances  from  the  earth  will  accurately  take  place. Now  that  this  proportion  has  been  established,  we  may  compare  the \nforces  of  the  several  planets  among  themselves  (p. 391). In  the  mean  distance  of  Jupiter  from  the  earth,  the  greatest  elongation \nof  the  outmost  satellite  from  Jupiter's  centre  (by  the  observations  of  Mr.", "t  elongation \nof  the  outmost  satellite  from  Jupiter's  centre  (by  the  observations  of  Mr. Flamsted]  is  8'  13\" ;  and  therefore  the  distance  of  the  satellite  from  the \ncentre  of  Jupiter  is  to  the  mean  distance  of  Jupiter  from  tne  centre  of  the \nsun  as  124  to  52012,  but  to  the  mean  distance  of  Venus  from  the  centre \nof  the  sun  as  124  to  7234;  and  their  periodic  times  are  16\u00a3d. and  224fd  ; \nand  from  hence  (according  to  Cor. II,  Prop. IV),  dividing  the  distances  by \nthe  squares  of  the  times,  we  infer  that  the  force  by  which  the  satellite  is \nimpelled  towards  Jupiter  is  to  the  force  by  which  Venus  is  impelled  to \nwards  the  sun  as  442  to  143 ;  and  if  we  diminish  the  force  by  which  the \nsatellite  is  impelled  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance  124  to \n7234,  we  shall  have  the  circum-jovial  force  in  the  distance  of  Venus  from \nthe  sun  to  the  circum-solar  force  by  which  Venus  is  impelled  as  yW  to \n143,  or  as  1  to  1100;  wherefore  at  equal  distances  the  circum-solar  force \nis  1100  times  greater  than  the  circum-jovial. And,  by  the  like  computation,  from  the  periodic  time  of  the  satellite  ot \nSaturn  15(l. 22h.", "by  the  like  computation,  from  the  periodic  time  of  the  satellite  ot \nSaturn  15(l. 22h. and  its  greatest  elongation  from  Saturn,  while  that  planet \nis  in  its  mean  distance  from  us,  3'  20\",  it  follows  that  the  distance  of  this \nsatellite  from  Saturn's  centre  is  to  the  distance  of  Venus  from  the  sun  as \n92|  to  7234;  and  from  thence  that  the  absolute  circum-solar  force  is  2360 \ntimes  greater  than  the  absolute  circum-saturnal. From  the  regularity  of  the  heliocentric  and  irregularity  of  the  geocen \ntric  motions  of  Venus,  of  Jupiter,  and  the  other  planets,  it  is  evident  (by \nCor. IV,  Prop. Ill)  that  the  circum-terrestrial  force,  compared  with  the  cir \ncum-solar,  is  very  small. Ricciolus  and  Vendelin  have  severally  tried  to  determine  the  sun's  par \nallax  from  the  moon's  dichotomies  observed  by  the  telescope,  and  they  agree \nthat  it  does  not  exceed  half  a  minute. Kepler,  from  Ti/cho's  observations  and  his  own,  found   the  parallax  of", "o22 \nTHE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. Mars  insensible,  even  in  opposition  to  the  sun,  when  that  parallax  is  some \nthing  greater  than  the  sun's. Flamsted  attempted  the  same  parallax  with  the  micrometer  in  the  peri- \ngeon  position  of  Mars,  but  never  found  it  above  25\" ;  and  thence  conclud \ned  the  sun's  parallax  at  most  10\". Whence  it  follows  that  the  distance  of  the  moon  from  the  earth  bears \nno  greater  proportion  to  the  distance  of  the  earth  from  the  sun  than  29  to \nIOUOO :  nor  to  the  distance  of  Venus  from  the  sun  than  29  to  7233. From  which  distances,  together  with  the  periodic  times,  by  the  method \nabove  explained,  it  is  easy  to  infer  that  the  absolute  circum-soiar  force  is \ngreater  than  the  absolute  circum-terrestrial  force  at  least  229400  times. And  though  we  were  only  certain,  from  the  observations  of  Ricciolus \nand  Vcitdelin,  that  the  sun's  parallax  was  less  than  half  a  minute,  yet  from \nthis  it  will  follow  that  the  absolute  circum-solar  force  exceeds  the  absolute \ncircum-terrestrial  force  S500  times.", "the  absolute  circum-solar  force  exceeds  the  absolute \ncircum-terrestrial  force  S500  times. By  the  like  computations  I  happened  to  discover  an  analogy,  that  is  ob \nserved  between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  but,  before  I  ex \nplain  this  analogy,  the  apparent  diameters  of  the  planets  in  their  mean \ndistances  from  the  earth  must  be  first  determined. Mr. Flamsted  (p. 387),  by  the  micrometer,  measured  the  diameter  of \nJupiter  40\"  or  41\";  the  diameter  of  Saturn's  ring  50\"  ;  and  the  diameter \nof  the  sun  about  32'  13\"  (p. 387). But  the  diameter  of  Saturn  is  to  the  diameter  of  the  ring,  according  to \nMr. Huygens  and  Dr. Halley,  as  4  to  9;  according  to  Gullet-ins,  as  4  to \n10;  and  according  to  Hooke  (by  a  telescope  of  60  feet),  as  5  to  12. And \nfrom  the  mean  proportion,  5  to  12,  the  diameter  of  Saturn's  body  is  in \nferred  about  21\". Such  as  we  have  said  are  the  apparent  magnitudes;  but. because  of  the \nunequal  refrano-ibility  of  light,  all  lucid  points  are  dilated  by  the  tele \nscope,  and  in  the  focus  of  the  object-glass  possess  a  circular  space  whose \nbreadth  is  about  the  50th  part  of  the  aperture  of  the  glass.", "a  circular  space  whose \nbreadth  is  about  the  50th  part  of  the  aperture  of  the  glass. It  is  true,  that  towards  the  circumference  the  light  is  Su  rare  as  hardly \nto  move  the  sense  ;  but  towards  the  middle,  where  it  is  of  greater  density, \nand  is  sensible  enough,  it  makes  a  small  lucid  circle,  whose  breadth  varies \naccording  to  the  splendor  of  the  lucid  point,  but  is  generally  about  the  3d, \nor  4th,  or  5th  part  of  the  breadth  of  the  whole. Let  ABD  represent  the  circle  of  the  whole  light;  PQ  the  small  circle \nof  the  denser  and  clearer  light;  C  the  centre  of  both;  CA,  CB,  semi-di \nameters  of  the  greater  circle  containing  a  right  angle  at  C ;  ACBE  the \nsquare  comprehended  under  these  semi-diameters  ;  AB  the  diagonal  of  that \nsquare;  EGH  an  hyperbola  with  the  centre  C  and  asymptotes  CA,  CB \nPG  a  perpendicular  erected  from  any  point  P  of  the  line  BC,  and  meeting \nthe  hyperbola  in  G,  and  the  right  lines  AB,  AE,  in  K  and  F  :  and  th\u00ab", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 523 \ndensity  of  the  light  in  any  place  P,  will,  by  my  computation,  be  as  the \nline  FG,  and  therefore  at  the  centre  infinite,  but  near  the  circumference \nvery  small. And  the  whole  light  within  the  small  circle  PQ,  is  to  the \nwithout  as  the  area  of  the  quadrilateral  figure  CAKP  to  the  trian- \ngle  PKB. And  we  are  to  understand  the  small  circle  PQ,  to  te  there \nterminated,  where  FG,  the  density  of  the  light,  begins  to  be  less  than  what \nis  required  to  move  the  sense. Hence  it  was,  that,  at  the  distance  of  191 382  feet,  a  fire  of  3  feet  in  di \nameter,  through  a  telescope  of  3  feet,  appeared  to  Mr. Picart  of  S\"  in \nbreadth,  when  it  should  have  appeared  only  of  3\"  14'\"  ;  and  hence  it  is \nthat  the  brighter  fixed  stars  appear  through  the  telescope  as  of  5\"  or  6\"  in \ndiameter,  and  that  with  a  good  full  light ;  but  with  a  fainter  light  they \nappear  to  run  out  to  a  greater  breadth.", "d  full  light ;  but  with  a  fainter  light  they \nappear  to  run  out  to  a  greater  breadth. Hence,  likewise,  it  was  that  He- \nvelius,  by  diminishing  the  aperture  of  the  telescope,  did  cut  off  a  great  part \nof  the  light  towards  the  circumference,  and  brought  the  disk  of  the  star  to \nbe  more  distinctly  defined,  which,  though  hereby  diminished,  did  yet  ap \npear  as  of  5\"  or  6\"  in  diameter. But  Mr. Hvyg'etis,  only  by  clouding  the \neye-glass  with  a  little  smoke,  did  so  effectually  extinguish  this  scattered \nlight,  that  the  fixed  stars  appeared  as  mere  points,  void  of  all  sensible \nbreadth. Hence  also  it  was  that  Mr. Huygens,  from  the  breadth  of  bodies \ninterposed  to  intercept  the  whole  light  of  the  planets,  reckoned  their  diam \neters  greater  than  others  hav\u00ab  measured  them  by  the  micrometer :  for  the", "524  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. scattered  light,  which  could  not  be  seen  before  for  the  stronger  light  of  the \nplanet,  when  the  planet  is  hid,  appears  every  way  farther  spread. Lastly, \nfrom  hence  it  is  that  the  planets  appear  so  small  in  the  disk  of  the  sun, \nbeing  lessened  by  the  dilated  light. For  to  Hevelius,  Galletius,  and  Dr. Halley,  Mercury  did  not  seem  to  exceed  12\"  or  15\" ;  and  Venus  appeared \nto  Mr. Crabtrie  only  1'  3;/ ;  to  Horrox  but  1'  12\" ;  though  by  the  men \nsurations  of  Hevelius  and  Hu&enius  without  the  sun's  disk,  it  ought  to \nhave  been  seen  at  least  1'  24\". Thus  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  moon, \nwhich  in  1 684,  a  few  days  both  before  and  after  the  sun's  eclipse,  was \nmeasured  at  the  observatory  of  Paris  31'  30\",  in  the  eclipse  itself  did  not \nseem  to  exceed  30  or  30'  05\" ;  and  therefore  the  diameters  of  the  planets \nare  to  be  diminished  when  without  the  sun,  and  to  be  augmented  when \nwithin  it,  by  some  seconds. But  the  errors  seem  to  be  less  than  usual  in \nthe  mensurations  that  are  made  by  the  micrometer. So  from  the  diameter \nof  the  shadow,  determined  by  the  eclipses  of  the  satellites,  Mr.", "So  from  the  diameter \nof  the  shadow,  determined  by  the  eclipses  of  the  satellites,  Mr. Flamsted \nfound  that  the  semi- diameter  of  Jupiter  was  to  the  greatest  elongation  of \nthe  outmost  satellite  as  1  to  24,903. Wherefore  since  that  elongation  is \n8'  13'',  the  diameter  of  Jupiter  will  be  39^-\" ;  and,  rejecting  the  scattered \nlight,  the  diameter  found  by  the  micrometer  40\"  or  41\"  will  be  reduced  to \n39|-\"  5  and  the  diameter  of  Saturn  21\"  is  to  be  diminished  by  the  like  cor \nrection,  and  to  be  reckoned  20\",  or  something  less. But  (if  I  am  not  mis \ntaken)  the  diameter  of  the  sun,  because  of  its  stronger  light,  is  to  be  dimin \nished  something  more,  and  to  be  reckoned  about  32',  or  32'  61'. That  bodies  so  different  in  magnitude  should  come  so  near  to  an  analogy \nwith  their  forces,  is  not  without  some  mystery  (p. 400). It  may  be  that  the  remoter  planets,  for  want  of  heat,  have  not  those  me \ntallic  substances  and  ponderous  minerals  with  which  our  earth  abounds ; \nand  that  the  bodies  of  Venus  and  Mercury,  as  they  are  more  exposed  to  the \nsun's  heat,  are  also  harder  baked,  and  more  compact.", "as  they  are  more  exposed  to  the \nsun's  heat,  are  also  harder  baked,  and  more  compact. For,  from  the  experiment  of  the  burning-glass,  we  see  that  the  heat  in \ncreases  with  the  density  of  light ;  and  this  density  increases  in  the  recipro \ncal  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance  from  the  sun ;  from  whence  the \nsan's  heat  in  Mercury  is  proved  to  be  sevenfold  its  heat  in  our  summer \nseasons. But  with  this  heat  our  water  boils ;  and  those  heavy  fluids,  quick \nsilver  and  the  spirit  of  vitriol,  gently  evaporate,  as  I  have  tried  by  the \nthermometer ;  and  therefore  there  can  be  no  fluids  in  Mercury  but  what \nare  heavy,  and  able  to  bear  a  great  heat,  and  from  which  substances  of  great \ndensity  may  be  nourished. And  why  not,  if  God  has  placed  different  bodies  at  different  distances \nfrom  the  sun,  so  as  the  denser  bodies  always  possess  the  nearer  places,  and \neach  body  enjoys  a  degree  of  heat  suitable  to  its  condition,  and  proper  for \nits  nourishment? From  this  consideration  it  will  best  appear  that  the \nweights  of  all  the  planets  are  one  to  another  as  their  forces.", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. But  I  should  be  glad  the  diameters  of  the  planets  were  more  accurately \nmeasured  ;  and  that  may  be  done,  if  a  lamp,  set  at  a  great  distance,  is  made \nto  shine  through  a  circular  hole,  and  both  the  hole  and  the  light  of  the \nlamp  are  so  diminished  that  the  spectrum  may  appear  through  the  telescope \njust  like  the  planet,  and  may  be  defined  by  the  same  measure :  then  the \ndiameter  of  the  hole  will  be  to  its  distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the \ntrue  diameter  of  the  planet  to  its  distance  from  us. The  light  of  the  lamp \nmay  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of \nsmoked  glass. Of  kin  to  the  analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is  another  observed \nbetween  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p. 395,  396,  397).", "ere  is  another  observed \nbetween  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p. 395,  396,  397). Since  the \naction  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  planets  decreases  in  the  duplicate \nproportion  of  the  distance,  and  the  periodic  time  increases  in  the  sesquipli- \ncate  thereof,  it  is  evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force,  and \ntherefore  the  periodic  times,  would  be  equal  in  equal  planets  at  equal  dis \ntances  from  the  sun ;  and  in  equal  distances  of  unequal  planets  the  total \nactions  of  the  centripetal  force  would  be  as  the  bodies  of  the  planets ;  for \nif  the  actions  were  not  proportional  to  the  bodies  to  be  moved,  they  could \nnot  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in  equal \ntimes :  nor  could  the  motions  of  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  be  so  regular,  if  it \nwas  not  that  the  circum-solar  force  was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and \nall  its  satellites  in  proportion  of  their  several  weights. And  the  same  thing \nis  to  be  said  of  Saturn  in  respect  of  its  satellites,  and  of  our  earth  in  re \nspect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor. II  and  III,  Prop. LXV.", "nd  of  our  earth  in  re \nspect  of  the  moon,  as  appears  from  Cor. II  and  III,  Prop. LXV. Arid, \ntherefore,  at  equal  distances,  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal \nupon  all  the  planets  in  proportion  of  their  bodies,  or  of  the  quantities  of \nmatter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for  the  same  reason  must  be  the  same \nupon  all  the  particles  of  the  same  size  of  which  the  planet  is  composed ;  for \nif  the  action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of  particles  than  upon  others  than \nin  proportion  to  their  quantity  of  matter,  it  would  be  also  greater  or  less \nupon  the  whole  planets  not  in  proportion  to  the  quantity  only,  but  like \nwise  of  the  sort  of  the  matter  more  copiously  found  in  one  and  more \nsparingly  in  another. In  such  bodies  as  are  found  on  our  earth  of  very  different  sorts,  I  exam \nined  this  analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p. 343,  344). If  the  action  of  the  circum-terrestrial  force  is  proportional  to  the  bodies \nto  be  moved,  it  will  (by  the  Second  Law  of  Motion)  move  them  with  equal \nvelocity  in  equal  times,  and  will  make  all  bodies  let  fall  to  descend  through \nequal  spaces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate \nin  equal  times.", "paces  in  equal  times,  and  all  bodies  hung  by  equal  threads  to  vibrate \nin  equal  times. If  the  action  of  the  force  was  greater,  the  times  would  be \nless ;  if  that  was  less,  these  would  be  greater. But  it  has  been  long  ago  observed  by  others,  that  (allowance  being  made \nfor  the  small  resistance  of  the  air)  all  bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces", "526 \nTHE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. in  equal  times ;  and,  by  the  help  of  pendulums,  that  equality  of  tim-es  may \nbe  distinguished  to  great  exactness. 1  tried  the  thing  in  gold,  silver,  lead,  glass,  sand,  common  salt  wood, \nwater,  and  wheat. I  provided  two  equal  wooden  boxes. I  filled  the  one \nwith  wood,  and  suspended  an  equal  weight  of  gold  (as  exactly  as  I  could) \nin  the  centre  of  oscillation  of  the  other. The  boxes,  hung  by  equal  threads \nof  11  feet,  made  a  couple  of  pendulums  perfectly  equal  in  weight  and  fig \nure,  and  equally  exposed  to  the  resistance  of  the  air :  and,  placing  the  one \nby  the  other,  I  observed  them  to  play  together  forwards  and  backwards  for \na  long  while,  with  equal  vibrations. And  therefore  (by  Cor. 1  and  VI, \nProp. XXIV. Book  II)  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  gold  was  to  the  quan \ntity  of  matter  in  the  wood  as  the  action  of  the  motive  force  upon  all  the \ngold  to  the  action  of  the  same  upon  all  the  wood  ;  that  is,  as  the  weight  of \nthe  one  to  the  weight  of  the  other. And  by  these  experiments,  in  bodies  of  the  same  weight,  could  have  dis \ncovered  a  difference  of  matter  less  than  the  thousandth  part  of  the  whole.", "d  have  dis \ncovered  a  difference  of  matter  less  than  the  thousandth  part  of  the  whole. Since  the  action  of  the  centripetal  force  upon  the  bodies  attracted  is,  at \nequal  distances,  proportional  to  the  quantities  of  matter  in  those  bodies, \nreason  requires  that  it  should  be  also  proportional  to  the  quantity  of  mat \nter  in  the  body  attracting. For  all  action  is  mutual,  and  (p. 83,  93. by  the  Third  Law  of  Motion) \nmakes  the  bodies  mutually  to  approach  one  to  the  other,  and  therefore  must \nbe  the  same  in  both  bodies. It  is  true  that  we  may  consider  one  body  as \nattracting,  another  as  attracted;  but  this  distinction  is  more  mathematical \nthan  natural. The  attraction  is  really  common  of  either  to  other,  and \ntherefore  of  the  same  kind  in  both. And  hence  it  is  that  the  attractive  force  is  found  in  both. The  sun  at \ntracts  Jupiter  and  the  other  planets ;  Jupiter  attracts  its  satellites ;  and, \nfor  the  same  reason,  the  satellites  act  as  well  one  upon  another  as  upon  Ju \npiter,  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  upon  another.", "ell  one  upon  another  as  upon  Ju \npiter,  and  all  the  planets  mutually  one  upon  another. And  though  the  mutual  actions  of  two  planets  may  be  distinguished \nand  considered  as  two,  by  which  each  attracts  the  other,  yet,  as  those  ac \ntions  are  intermediate,  they  do  not  make  two  but  one  operation  between \ntwo  terms. Two  bodies  may  be  mutually  attracted  each  to  the  other  by \nthe  contraction  of  a  cord  interposed. There  is  a  double  cause  of  action, \nto  wit,  the  disposition  of  both  bodies,  as  well  as  a  double  action  in  so  far \nas  the  action  is  considered  as  upon  two  bodies ;  but  as  betwixt  two  bodies \nit  is  but  one  single  one. It  is  not  one  action  by  which  the  sun  attracts \nJupiter,  and  another  by  which  Jupiter  attracts  the  sun  ;  but  it  is  one  ac \ntion  by  which  the  sun  and  Jupiter  mutually  endeavour  to  approach  each \nthe  other. By  the  action  with  which  the  sun  attracts  Jupiter,  Jupiter  and \nthe  sun  endeavours  to  come  nearer  together  (by  the  Third  Law  of  Mo \ntion)  ;  and  by  the  action  with  which  Jupiter  attracts  the  sun,  likewise  Ju-", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 527 \npitcr  and  the  sun  endeavor  to  come  nearer  together. But  the  sun  is  not \nattracted  towards  Jupiter  by  a  twofold  action,  nor  Jupiter  by  a  twofold \naction  towards  the  sun  ;  but  it  is  one  single  intermediate  action,  by  which \nboth  approach  nearer  together. Thus  iron  draws  the  load-stone  (p. 93),  as  well  as  the  load-stone \ndraws  the  iron  :  for  all  iron  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  load-stone  draws \nother  iron. But  the  action  betwixt  the  load-stone  and  iron  is  single,  and \nis  considered  as  single  by  the  philosophers. The  action  of  iron  upon  the \nload-stone,  is,  indeed,  the  action  of  the  load-stone  betwixt  itself  and  the \niron,  by  which  both  endeavour  to  come  nearer  together :  and  so  it  mani \nfestly  appears ;  for  if  you  remove  the  load-stone,  the  whole  force  of  the \niron  almost  ceases. Tn  this  sense  it  is  that  we  are  to  conceive  one  single  action  to  be  ex \nerted  betwixt  two  planets,  arising  from  the  conspiring  natures  of  both  : \nand  this  action  standing  in  the  same  relation  to  both,  if  it  is  proportional \nto  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  one,  it  will  be  also  proportional  to  the \nquantity  of  matter  in  the  other.", "ter  in  the  one,  it  will  be  also  proportional  to  the \nquantity  of  matter  in  the  other. Perhaps  it  may  be  objected,  that,  according  to  this  philosophy  (p. 39S), \nall  bodies  should  mutually  attract  one  another,  contrary  to  the  evidence \nof  experiments  in  terrestrial  bodies ;  but  I  answer,  that  the  experiments  in \nterrestrial  bodies  come  to  no  account ;  for  the  attraction  of  homogeneous \nspheres  near  their  surfaces  are  (by  Prop. LXXII)  as  their  diameters. Whence  a  sphere  of  one  foot  in  diameter,  and  of  a  like  nature  to  the \nearth,  would  attract  a  small  body  placed  near  its  surface  with  a  force \n20UOOOOO  times  less  than  the  earth  would  do  if  placed  near  its  surface; \nbut  so  small  a  force  could  produce  no  sensible  effect. If  two  such  spheres \nwere  distant  but  by  1  of  an  inch,  they  would  not,  even  in  spaces  void  of", "528  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. resistance,  come  together  by  the  force  of  their  mutual  attraction  in  less \nthan  a  month's  time  j  and  less  spheres  will  come  together  at  a  rate  yet \nslower,  viz.. in  the  proportion  of  their  diameters. Nay,  whole  mountains \nwill  not  be  sufficient  to  produce  any  sensible  effect. A  mountain  of  an \nhemispherical  figure,  three  miles  high,  and  six  broad,  will  not,  by  its  at \ntraction,  draw  the  pendulum  two  minutes  out  of  the  true  perpendicular : \nand  it  is  only  in  the  great  bodies  of  the  planets  that  these  forces  are  to  be \nperceived,  unless  we  may  reason  about  smaller  bodies  in  manner  following. Let  ABCD  (p. 93)  represent  the  globe  of  the  earth  cut  by  any  plane \nAC  into  two  parts  ACB,  and  A  CD. The  part  ACB  bearing  upon  the \npart  ACD  presses  it  with  its  whole  weight;  nor  can  the  part  ACD  sustain \nthis  pressure  and  continue  unmoved,  if  it  is  not  opposed  by  an  equal  con \ntrary  pressure. And  therefore  the  parts  equally  press  each  other  by  their \nweights,  that  is,  equally  attract  each  other,  according  to  the  third  Law  of \nMotion  ;  and,  if  separated  and  let  go,  would  fall  towards  each  other  with \nvelocities  reciprocally  as  the  bodies.", "and  let  go,  would  fall  towards  each  other  with \nvelocities  reciprocally  as  the  bodies. All  which  we  may  try  and  see  in  the \nload-stone,  whose  attracted  part  does  not  propel  the  part  attracting,  but  is \nonly  stopped  and  sustained  thereby. Suppose  now  that  ACB  represents  some  small  body  on  the  earth's  sur \nface  :  then,  because  the  mutual  attractions  of  this  particle,  and  of  the  re \nmaining  part  ACD  of  the  earth  towards  each  other,  are  equal,  but  the \nattraction  of  the  particle  towards  the  earth  (or  its  weight)  is  as  the  matter \nof  the  particle  (as  we  have  proved  by  the  experiment  of  the  pendulums), \nthe  attraction  of  the  earth  towards  the  particle  will  likewise  be  as  the \nmatter  of  the  particle ;  and  therefore  the  attractive  forces  of  all  terres \ntrial  bodies  will  be  as  their  several  quantities  of  matter. The  forces  (p. 396),  which  are  as  the  matter  in  terrestrial  bodies  of  all \nforms,  and  therefore  are  not  mutable  with  the  forms,  must  be  found  in  all \nsorts  of  bodies  whatsoever,  celestial  as  well  as  terrestrial,  and  be  in  all \nproportional  to  their  quantities  of  matter,  because  among  all  there  is  no \ndifference  of  substance,  but  of  modes  and  forms  only.", ",  because  among  all  there  is  no \ndifference  of  substance,  but  of  modes  and  forms  only. But  in  the  celes \ntial  bodies  the  same  thing  is  likewise  proved  thus. We  have  shewn  that \nthe  action  of  the  circum-solar  force  upon  all  the  planets  (reduced  to  equal \ndistances)  is  as  the  matter  of  the  planets  ;  that  the  action  of  the  circum- \njovial  force  upon  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  observes  the  same  law  ;  and  the \nsame  thing  is  to  be  said  of  the  attraction  of  all  the  planets  towards  every \nplanet :  but  thence  it  follows  (by  Prop. LXIX)  that  their  attractive  forces \nare  as  their  several  quantities  of  matter. As  the  parts  of  the  earth  mutually  attract  one  another,  so  do  those  of \nall  the  planets. If  Jupiter  and  its  satellites  were  brought  together,  and \nformed  into  one  globe,  without  doubt  they  would  continue  mutually  to \nattract  one  another  as  before. And,  on  the  other  hand,  if  the  body  of \nJupiter  was  broke  into  more  globes,  to  be  sure,  these  would  no  less  attract.", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 529 \n3ne  another  than  they  do  the  satellites  now. From  these  attractions  it  is \nthat  the  bodies  of  the  earth  and  all  the  planets  effect  a  spherical  figure,  and \ntheir  parts  cohere,  and  are  not  dispersed  through  the  aether. But  we  have \nbefore  proved  that  these  forces  arise  from  the  universal  nature  of  matter \n(p. 398),  and  that,  therefore,  the  force  of  any  whole  globe  is  made  up  of \nthe  several  forces  of  all  its  parts. And  from  thence  it  follows  (by  Cor. III,  Prop. LXXIV)  that  the  force  of  every  particle  decreases  in  the  dupli \ncate  proportion  of  the  distance  from  that  particle  ;  and  (by  Prop. LXXIII \nand  LXXV)  that  the  force  of  an  entire  globe,  reckoning  from  the  surface \noutwards,  decreases  in  the  duplicate,  but,  reckoning  inwards,  in  the  sim \nple  proportion  of  the  distances  from  the  centres,  if  the  matter  of  the  globe \nbe  uniform. And  though  the  matter  of  the  globe,  reckoning  from   the \ncentre  towards  the  surface,  is  not  uniform  (p. 398,  399),  yet  the  decrease  in \nthe  duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance  outwards  would  (by  Prop. LXXVI) \ntake  place,  provided   that  difformity   is  similar  in  places  round  about  at \nequal  distances  from  the  centre.", "that  difformity   is  similar  in  places  round  about  at \nequal  distances  from  the  centre. And  two  sucli  globes  will  (by  the  same \nProposition)  attract  one  the  other  with  a  force  decreasing  in  the  duplicate \nproportion  of  the  distance  between,  their  centres. Wherefore  the  absolute  force  of  every  globe  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter \nwhich  the  globe  contains ;  but  the  motive  force  by  which  every  globe  is \nattracted  towards  another,  and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we  commonly \ncall  their  weight,  is  as  the  content  under  the  quantities  of  matter  in  both \nglobes  applied  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between  their  centres  (by  Cor. IV,  Prop. LXXVI),  to  which  force  the  quantity  of  motion,  by  which  each \nglobe  in  a  given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is  proportional. And  the  accelerative  force,  by  which  every  globe  according  to  its  quantity \nof  matter  is  attracted  towards  another,  is  as  the  quantity  of  matter  in  that \nother  globe  applied   to   the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  centres  of \nthe  two  (by  Cor. II,  Prop. LXXVI):  to  which  force,  the  velocity  by  which \nthe  attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is \nproportional.", "attracted  globe  will,  in   a  given  time,  be  carried  towards  the  other  is \nproportional. And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it  will  be  now \neasy  to  determine  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  among  themselves. From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we  have \nabove  seen  that  the  circum-solar  does  more  than  a  thousand  times  exceed \nall  the  rest ;  but  by  the  action  of  a  force  so  greab  it  is  unavoidable  but  that \nall  bodies  within,  nay,  and  far  beyond,  the  bounds  of  the  planetary  system \nmust  descend  directly  to  the  sun,  unless  by  other  motions  they  are  impelled \ntowards  other  parts :  nor  is  our  earth  to  be  excluded  from  the  number  of \nsuch  bodies :  for  certainly  the  moon  is  a  body  of  the  same  nature  with  the \nplanets,  and  subject  to  the  same  attractions  with  the  other  planets,  seeing \nit  is  by  the  circum-terrestrial  force  that  it  is  retained  in  its  orbit. But \nthat  the  earth  and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun,  we  have \nabove  proved ;  we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all  bodies  are  subject  to", "530 \nTHE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. the  said  common  laws  of  attraction. Nay,  supposing  any  of  those  bodies \nto  be  deprived  of  its  circular  motion  about  the  sun,  by  having  its  distance \nfrom  the  sun,  we  may  find  (by  Prop. XXXVI)  in  what  space  of  time  it \nwould  in  its  descent  arrive  at  the  sun  ;  to  wit,  in  half  that  periodic  time  in \n.vhich  the  body  might  be  revolved  at  one  half  of  its  former  distance;  or  in \na  space  of  time  that  is  to  the  periodic  time  of  the  planet  as  1  to  4</2;  as \nthat  Venus  in  its  descent  would  arrive  at  the  sun  in  the  space  of  40  days, \nJupiter  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and  moon \ntogether  in  the  space  of  66  days  and  19  hours. But,  since  no  such  thing \nhappens,  it  must  needs  be,  that  those  bodies  are  moved  towards  other  parts \n(p. 75),  nor  is  every  motion  sufficient  for  this  purpose. To  hinder  such  a \ndescent,  a  due  proportion  of  velocity  is  required. And  hence  depends  the \nforce  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the \nplanets.", "s  the \nforce  of  the  argument  drawn  from  the  retardation  of  the  motions  of  the \nplanets. Unless  the  circum-solar  force  decreased  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of \ntheir  increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to  de \nscend  to  the  sun  ;  for  instance,  if  the  motion  (c&teris  paribns)  was  retarded \nby  one  half,  the  planet  would  be  retained  in  its  orb  by  one  fourth  of  the \nformer  circum-solar  force,  and  by  the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths \nwould  descend  to  the  sun. And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter, \nMars,  Venus,  and  Mercury)  are  not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor \nbecome  really  stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions. All  these  are \nbut  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by  which  the  planets  continue  to \nrevolve  in  their  orbits,  are  always  direct,  and  nearly  equable. But  that \nsuch  motions  are  performed  about  the  sun,  we  have  already  proved ;  and \ntherefore  the  sun,  as  the  centre  of  the  absolute  motions,  is  quiescent. For \nwe  can  by  no  means  allow  quiescence  to  the  earth,  lest  the  planets  in  their \nperigees  should  indeed  be  truly  retarded,  and  become  truly  stationary  and \nregressive,  and  so  for  want  of  motion  should  descend  to  the  sun.", "truly  stationary  and \nregressive,  and  so  for  want  of  motion  should  descend  to  the  sun. But \nfarther ;  since  the  planets  (Venus,  Mars,  Jupiter,  and  the  rest)  by  radi: \ndrawn  to  the  sun  describe  regular  orbits,  and  areas  (as  WTC  have  shewn) \nnearly  and  to  sense  proportional  to  the  times,  it  follows  (by  Prop. III. and \nCor. Ill,  Prop. LXV)  that  the  sun  is  moved  with  no  notable  force,  unless \nperhaps  wTith  such  as  all  the  planets  are  equally  moved  with,  according  to \ntheir  several  quantities  of  matter,  in  parallel  lines,  and  so  the  whole  sys \ntem  is  transferred  in  right  lines. Reject  that  translation  of  the  whole \nsystem,  and  the  sun  will  be  almost  quiescent  in  the  centre  thereof. If  the \ngun  was  revolved  about  the  earth,  and  carried  the  other  planets  round  about \nitself,  the  earth  ought  to  attract  the  sun  with  a  great  force,  but  the  cir \ncum-solar  planets  with  no  force  producing  any  sensible  effect,  which  is \ncontrary  to  Cor. Ill,  Prop. LXV.", "with  no  force  producing  any  sensible  effect,  which  is \ncontrary  to  Cor. Ill,  Prop. LXV. Add  to  this,  that  if  hitherto  the  earth, \nbecause  of  the  gravitation  of  its  parts,  has  been  placed  by  most  authors  in \nthe  lowermost  region  of  the  universe ;  now,  for  better  reason,  the  sun  pos \nsessed  of  a  centripetal  force  exceeding  our  terrestrial  gravitation  a  thousand", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WJP.I.D. 53L \ntimes  and  more,  ought  to  be  depressed  into  the  lowermost  place,  and  to  be \nheld  for  the  centre  of  the  system. And  thus  the  true  disposition  of  the \nwhole  system  will  be  more  fully  and  more  exactly  understood. Because  the  fixed  stars  are  quiescent  one  in  respect  of  another  (p. 401, \n4U2),  we  may  consider  the  sun,  earth,  and  planets,  as  one  system  of  bodies \ncarried  hither  and  thither  by  various  motions  among  themselves;  and  the \ncommon  centre  of  gravity  of  all  (by  Cor. IT  of  the  Laws  of  Motion)  will \neither  be  quiescent,  or  move  uniformly  forward  in  a  right  line :  in  which \ncase  the  whole  system  will  likewise  move  uniformly  forward  in  right  lines. But  this  is  an  hypothesis  hardly  to  be  admitted ;  and,  therefore,  setting  it \narfide,  that  common  centre  will  be  quiescent:  and  from  it  the  sun  is  never \nfar  removed.", "fide,  that  common  centre  will  be  quiescent:  and  from  it  the  sun  is  never \nfar  removed. The  common  centre  of  gravity  of  the  sun  and  Jupiter  falls \non  the  surface  of  the  sun ;  and  though  all  the  planets  were  placed  towards \nthe  same  parts  from  the  sun  with  Jupiter  the  common  centre  of  the  sun \nand  all  of  them  would  scarcely  recede  twice  as  far  from  the  sun's  centre ; \nand,  therefore,  though  the  sun,  according  to  the  various  situation  of  the \nplanets,  is  variously  agitated,  and  always  wandering  to  and  fro  with  a  slow \nmotion  of  libration,  yet  it  never  recedes  one  entire  diameter  of  its  own  body \nfrom  the  quiescent  centre  of  the  whole  system. But  from  the  weights  of \nthe  sun  and  planets  above  determined,  and  the  situation  of  all  among  them \nselves,  their  common  centre  of  gravity  may  be  found  ;  and,  this  being  given, \nthe  sun's  place  to  any  supposed  time  may  be  obtained. About  the  sun  thus  librated  the  other  planets  are  revolved  in  elliptic \norbits  (p  403),  and,  by  radii  drawn  to  the  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro \nportional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop. LXV.", "e  sun,  describe  areas  nearly  pro \nportional  to  the  times,  as  is  explained  in  Prop. LXV. If  the  sun  was  qui \nescent,  and  the  other  planets  did  not  act  mutually  one  upon  another,  their \norbits  would  be  elliptic,  and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the  times  (by \nProp. XI,  and  Cor. 1,  Prop. XIII). But  the  actions  of  the  planets  amonir \nthemselves,  compared  with  the  actions  of  the  sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no \nmoment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors. And  those  errors  are  less  in  rev \nolutions  about  the  sun  agitated  in  the  manner  but  now  described  than  if \nthose  revolutions  were  made  about  the  sun  quiescent  (by  Prop. LXV1,  and \nCor. Prop. LXVIll),  especially  if  the  focus  of  every  orbit  is  placed  in  the \ncommon  centre  of  gravity  of  all  the  lower  included  planets;  viz.,  the  focus \nof  the  orbit  of  Mercury  in  the 'centre  of  the  sun :  the  focus  of  the  orbit  of \nVenus  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Mercury  and  the  sun  ;  the  focus \nof  the  orbit  of  thp  earth  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Venus,  Mer \ncury,  and  the  sun ;  and  so  of  the  rest.", "the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Venus,  Mer \ncury,  and  the  sun ;  and  so  of  the  rest. And  by  this  means  the  foci  of  the \ncrbits  of  all  the  planets,  except  Saturn,  will  not  be  sensibly  removed  from \nthe  centre  of  the  sun,  nor  will  the  focus  of  the  orbit  of  Saturn  recede  sensi \nbly  from  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  and  the  sun. And \ntherefore  astronomers  are  not  far  from  the  truth,  when  they  reckon  the \nsun's  centre  the  common  focus  of  all  the  planetary  orbits. In  Saturn  itself", "THE    SYSTEM    CF    THE    W  )RLD. the  error  thence  arising  docs  not  exceed  1 '  45''. And  if  its  orbit,  by  placing \nthe  focus  thereof  in  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of  Jupiter  and  the  sun, \nghall  happen  to  agree  better  with  the  phenomena,  from  thence  all  that  we \nhave  said  will  be  farther  confirmed. If  the  sun  was  quiescent,  and  the  planets  did  not  act  one  on  another,  the \naphelions  and  nodes  of  their  orbits  would  likewise  (by  Prop. 1,  XI,  and  Cor. Prop. XIU)  be  quiescent. And  the  longer  axes  of  their  elliptic  orbits \nwould  (by  Prop. XV)  be  as  the  cubic  roots  of  the  squares  of  their  periodic \ntimes  :  and  therefore  from  the  given  periodic  times  would  be  also  given. But  those  times  are  to  be  measured  not  from  the  equinoctial  points,  which \nare  rnoveable,  but  from  the  first  star  of  Aries. Put  the  semi-axis  of  the \nearth's  orbit  100000,  and  the  semi-axes  of  the  orbits  of  Saturn,  Jupiter, \nMars,  Venus,  and  Mercury,  from  their  periodic  times,  will  come  out \n953806,  520116,  152399,  72333,  38710  respectively. But  from  the  sun's \nmotion  every  semi-axis  is  increased  (bv  Prop. LX)  by  about  one  third  of \nthe  distance  of  the  sun's  centre  from  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of \nthe  sun  and  planet  (p.", "ance  of  the  sun's  centre  from  the  common  centre  of  gravity  of \nthe  sun  and  planet  (p. 405,  406.)  And  from  the  actions  of  the  exterior \nplanets  on  the  interior,  the  periodic  times  of  the  interior  are  something \nprotracted,  though  scarcely  by  any  sensible  quantity ;  and  their  aphelions \nare  transferred  (by  Cor. VI  and  VII,  Prop. LXVI)by  very  slow  motions \nin  conset/ue/ttia. And  on  the  like  account  the  periodic  times  of  all,  espe \ncially  of  the  exterior  planets,  will  be  prolonged  by  the  actions  of  the \nsomets,  if  any  such  there  are,  without  the  orb  of  Saturn,  and  the  aphe \nlions  of  all  will  be  thereby  carried  forwards  in  consequent-la. But  from \nthe  progress  of  the  aphelions  the  regress  of  the  nodes  follows  (by  Cor. XI,  XIII,  Prop. 1  jXVI). And  if  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic  is  quiescent,  the \nregress  of  the  nodes  (by  Cor. XVI,  Prop. LX.VI)  will  be  to  the  progress  of \n*he  aphelion  in  every  orbit  as  the  regress  of  the  nodes  of  the  moon's  orbit \nto  the  progress  of  its  apogeon  nearly,  that  is,  as  about  10  to  21. But  as \ntronomical  observations  seem  to  confirm  a  very  slow  progress  of  the  aphe \nlions,  and  a  regress  of  the  nodes  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars.", "rogress  of  the  aphe \nlions,  and  a  regress  of  the  nodes  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars. And  hence \nit  is  probable  that  there  are  comets  in  the  regions  beyond  the  planets,  which, \nrevolving  in  very  eccentric  orbs,  quickly  fly  through  their  perihelion  parts, \nand,  by  an  exceedingly  slow  motion  in  their  aphelions,  spend  almost  their \nwhole  time  in  the  regions  beyond  the  planets  ;  as  we  shall  afterwards  ex \nplain  more  at  large. The  planets  thus  revolved  about  the  sun  (p. 413,  41.4,  415)  may  at  the \nsame  time  carry  others  revolving  about  themselves  as  satellites  or  moons, \nas  appears  by  Prop. LXVI. But  from  the  action  of  the  sun  our  moon \nmust  move  with  greater  velocity,  and,  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  earth,  de \nscribe  an  area  greater  for  the  time ;  it  must  have  its  orbit  less  curve,  and \ntherefore  approach  nearer  to  the  earth  in  the  syzygies  than  in  the  quadra \ntures,  except  in  so  far  as  the  motion  of  eccentricity  hinders  those  effects.", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 533 \nPer  the  eccentricity  is  greatest  when  the  moon's  apogeon  is  in  the  syzygies, \nand  least  when  the  same  is  in  the  quadratures ;  and  hence  it  is  that  the \nperigeon  moon  is  swifter  and  nearer  to  us,  but  the  apogeon  moon  slower  and \nfarther  from  us,  in  the  syzygies  than  in  the  quadratures. But  farther;  the \napogeon  has  a  progressive  and  the  nodes  a  regressive  motion,  both  unequa \nble. For  the  apogeon  is  more  swiftly  progressive  in  its  syzygies,  more \nslowly  regressive  in  its  quadratures,  and  by  the  excess  of  its  progress  above \nits  regress  is  yearly  transferred  in  coiisequentia  ;  but  the  nodes  are  quies \ncent  in  their  syzygies,  and  most  swiftly  regressive  in  their  quadratures. But \nfarther,  still,  the  greatest  latitude  of  the  moon  is  greater  in  its  quadra \ntures  than  in  its  syzygies  ;  and  the  mean  motion  swifter  in  the  aphelion  of \nthe  earth  than  in  its  perihelion. More  inequalities  in  the  moon's  motion \nhave  not  hitherto  been  taken  notice  of  by  astronomers :  but  all  these  fol \nlow  from  our  principles  in  Cor. II,  III,  IV,  V,  VI,  VII,  VIII,  IX,  X,  XI, \nXII,  XIII,  Prop. LXVI,  and  are  known  really  to  exist  in  the  heavens.", "VIII,  IX,  X,  XI, \nXII,  XIII,  Prop. LXVI,  and  are  known  really  to  exist  in  the  heavens. And  this  may  seen  in  that  most  ingenious,  and  if  I  mistake  not,  of  all,  the \nmost  acccurate,  hypothesis  of  Mr. Horrnx,  which  Mr. Flamsted  has  fitted \nto  the  heavens  ;  but  the  astronomical  hypotheses  are  to  be  corrected  in  the \nmotion  of  the  nodes  ;  for  the  nodes  admit  the  greatest  equation  or  pros- \nthaphaeresis  in  their  octants,  and  this  inequality  is  most  conspicuous  when \nthe  moon  is  in  the  nodes,  and  therefore  also  in  the  octants ;  and  hence  it \nwas  that  Tycho,  and  others  after  him,  referred  this  inequality  to  the \noctants  of  the  moon,  and  made  it  menstrual;  but  the  reasons  by  us  addu \nced  prove  that  it  ought  to  be  referred  to  the  octants  of  the  nodes,  and  to \nbe  made  annual. Beside  those  inequalities  taken  notice  of  by  astronomers  (p. 414,  445, \n447,)  there  are  yet  some  others,  by  which  the  moon's  motions  are  so  dis \nturbed,  that  hitherto  by  no  law  could  they  be  reduced  to  any  certain  regu \nlation.", "dis \nturbed,  that  hitherto  by  no  law  could  they  be  reduced  to  any  certain  regu \nlation.

XIV,  Prop. LXVI)  in  the  triplicate  ratio \nof  the  sun's  apparent  diameter. Beside  that,  the  variation  is  mutable \nr.sarly  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  time  between  the  quadratures  (by  Cor. I  and  II,  Lem. X,  and  Cor. XVI,  Prop. LXVI);  and  all  those  inequali \nties  are  something  greater  in  that  part  of  the  orbit  which  respects  the  sun \nthan  in  the  opposite  part,  but  by  a  difference  that  is  scarcely  or  not  at  all \nperceptible. By  a  computation  (p. 422),  which  for  brevity's  sake  I  do  not  describe,  1 \nalso  find  that  the  area  which  the  moon  by  a  radius  drawn  to  the  earth \ndescribes  in  the  several  equal  moments  of  time  is  nearly  as  the  sum  of  the \nnumber  237 T\\,  and  versed  sine  of  the  double  distance  of  the  moon  frour.", "534  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. the  nearest  quadrature  in  a  circle  whose  radius  is  unity  ;  and  therefore \nthat  the  square  of  the  moon's  distance  from  the  earth  is  as  that  sum  divid \ned  by  the  horary  motion  of  the  moon. Thus  it  is  when  the  variation  in \nthe  octants  is  in  its  mean  quantity  ;  but  if  the  variation  is  greater  or  less, \nthat  versed  sine  must  be  augmented  or  diminished  in  the  same  ratio. Let \nastronomers  try  how  exactly  the  distances  thus  found  will  agree  with  fjie \nmoon's  apparent  diameters. From  the  motions  of  our  moon  we  may  derive  the  motions  of  themoon* \nor  satellites  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn  (p. 413);  for  the  mean  motion  of  the \nnodes  of  the  outmost  satellite  of  Jupiter  is  to  the  mean  motion  of  the  nodes \nof  our  moon  in  a  proportion  compounded  of  the  duplicate  proportion  of \nthe  periodic  time  of  the  earth  about  the  sun  to  the  periodic  time  of  Jupiter \nabout  the  sun,  and  the  simple  proportion  of  the  periodic  time  of  the  sat \nellite  about  Jupiter  to  the  periodic  time  of  our  moon  about  the  earth  (by \nGor. XVI,  Prop. LXVI) :  and  therefore  those  nodes,  in  the  space  of  a  hun \ndred  years,  are  carried  8\u00b0  24'  backwards,  or  in  atitecedeutia.", "in  the  space  of  a  hun \ndred  years,  are  carried  8\u00b0  24'  backwards,  or  in  atitecedeutia. The  mean \nmotions  of  the  nodes  of  the  inner  satellites  are  to  the  (mean)  motion  of \n(the  nodes  of)  the  outmost  as  their  periodic  times  to  the  periodic  time  of \nthis,  by  the  same  corollary,  and  are  thence  given. And  the  motion  of  the \napsis  of  every  satellite  in  consequentia  is  to  the  motion  of  its  nodes  in \na/ttecedentia,  as  the  motion  of  the  apogee  of  our  moon  to  the  motion  of  i's \nnodes  (by  the  same  Corollary),  and  is  thence  given. The  greatest  equa \ntions  of  the  nodes  and  line  of  the  apses  of  each  satellite  are  to  the  greatest \nequations  of  the  nodes  and  the  line  of  the  apses  of  the  moon  respectively \nas  the  motion  of  the  nodes  and  line  of  the  apses  of  the  satellites  in  the \ntime  of  one  resolution  of  the  first  equations  to  the  motion  of  the  nodes \nand  apogeon  of  the  moon  in  the  time  of  one  revolution  of  the  last  equa \ntions.", "nodes \nand  apogeon  of  the  moon  in  the  time  of  one  revolution  of  the  last  equa \ntions.

From  the  small  quantity  of  those  inequalities,  and  the  slowness  of  the \nmotions,  it  happens  that  the  motions  of  the  satellites  are  found  to  be  so \nregular,  that  the  more  modern  astronomers  either  deny  all  motion  to  the \nnodes,  or  affirm  them  to  be  very  slowly  regressive. (P. 404). While  the  planets  are  thus  revolved  in  orbits  about  remote \ncentres,  in  the  mean  time  they  make  their  several  rotations  about  their \nproper  axes;  the  sun  in  26  days;  Jupiter  in  9h. 56' ;  Mars  in  24f,h. ; \nVenus  in  23h. ;  and  that  in  planes  not  much  inclined  to  the  plane  of  the \necliptic,  and  according  to  the  order  of  the  signs,  as  astronomers  determine \nfrom  the  spots  or  macula?", "ccording  to  the  order  of  the  signs,  as  astronomers  determine \nfrom  the  spots  or  macula? that  by  turns  present  themselves  to  our  sight  in \ntheir  bodies;  and  there  is  a  like  revolution  of  our  earth  performed  in  24h. ;", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE     WORLU. 535 \nfind  those  motions  are  neither  accelerated  \u2022  nor  retarded  l>y  the  actions  of \nthe  centripetal  forces,  as  appears  by  Cor. XXII,  Prop. LXVI  ;  and  there \nfore  of  all  others  they  are  the  most  equable  and  most  fit  for  the  mensura \ntion  of  time;  but  those  revolutions  are  to  be  reckoned  equable  not  from \ntheir  return  to  the  sun,  but  to  some  fixed  star:  for  as  the  position  of  the \nplanets  to  the  sun  is  un equably  varied,  the  revolutions  of  those  planets \nfrom  sun  to  sun  are  rendered  unequable.

To  determine  exactly  the  position  of  the  moon's  axis  to  the \nfixed  stars,  and  the  variation  of  this  position,  is  a  problem  worthy  of  an \nastronomer. By  reason  of  the  diurnal  revolutions  of  the  planets,  the  matter  which \nthey  contain  endeavours  to  recede  from  the  axis  of  this  motion ;  and  hence \nthe  fluid  parts  rising  higher  towards  the  equator  than  about  the  poles \n(p. 405),  would  lay  the  solid  parts  about  the  equator  under  water,  if  those \nparts  did  not  rise  also  (p. 405,  409)  :  upon  which  account  the  planets  are \nsomething  thicker  about  the  equator  than  about  the  poles ;  and  their  equi \nnoctial  points  (p. 413)  thence  become  regressive  ;  and  their  axes,  by  a \nmotion  of  nutation,  twice  in  every  revolution,  librate  towards  their  eclip \ntics,  and  twice  return  again  to  their  former  inclination,  as  is  explained  in \nCor. XVIII,  Prop. LXVI ;  and  hence  it  is  that  Jupiter,  viewed  through \nvery  long  telescopes,  does  not  appear  altogether  round  (p. 409). but  having \nits  diameter  that  lies  parallel  to  the  ecliptic  something  longer  than  that \nwhich  is  drawn  from  north  to  south.", "arallel  to  the  ecliptic  something  longer  than  that \nwhich  is  drawn  from  north  to  south.

But  till  that  time  is  more  certainly  determined  by  the  pheno \nmena,  choosing  the  middle  between  those  extremes,  why  may  we  not \nconjecture  the  greatest  height  of  the  water  to  happen  at  the  third  hour  ? for  thus  the  water  will  rise  all  that  time  in  which  the  force  of  the  lumi \nnaries  to  raise  it  is  greater,  and  will  fall  all  that  time  in  which  their  force \nis  less :  viz.,  from  the  ninth  to  the  third  hour  when  that  force  is  greater, \nand  from  the  third  to  the  ninth  when  it  is  less.

And  because  (as  experience  tells  us)  the  force  of  the  moon  is  greater  than \nthat  of  the  sun,  the  greatest  height  of  the  water  will  happen  about  the \nthird  lunar  hour.", "of  the  sun,  the  greatest  height  of  the  water  will  happen  about  the \nthird  lunar  hour.

Whence  it  comes  to  pasa  that  two \nnighest  tides  do  not  follow  one  the  other  in  two  immediately  succeeding \nsyzygies. The  effect  of  either  luminary  doth  likewise  depend  upon  its  declination \nor  distance  from  the  equator ;  for  if  the  luminary  was  placed  at  the  pole, \nit  would  constantly  attract  all  the  parts  of  the  waters,  without  any  inten \nsion  or  remission  of  its  action,  and  could  cause  no  reciprocation  of  motion  ; \nand,  therefore,  as  the  luminaries  decline  from  the  equator  towards  either \npole,  they  will  by  degrees  lose  their  force,  and  on  this  account  will  excite \nlesser  tides  in  the  solstitial  than  in  the  equinoctial  syzygies. But  in  the \nsolstitial  quadratures  they  will  raise  greater  tides  than  in  the  quadratures \nabout  the  equinoxes  ;  because  the  effect  of  the  moon,  then  situated  in  the \nequator,  most  exceeds  the  effect  of  the  sun  ;  therefore  the  greatest  tides \nfall  out  in  those  syzygies. and  the  least  in  those  quadratures,  which  happen \nabout  the  time  of  both  equinoxes  ;  and  the  greatest  tide  in  the  syzygies  is \nalways  succeeded  by  the  least  tide  in  the  quadratures,  as  we  lind  by  expe \nrience.", "is \nalways  succeeded  by  the  least  tide  in  the  quadratures,  as  we  lind  by  expe \nrience.

But  the  motions  which  we  have  been  describing  suffer  some  alteration \nfrom  that  force  of  reciprocation  which  the  waters  [having  once  received] \nretain  a  little  while  by  their  vis  iiisita  ;  whence  it  comes  to  pass  that  the \ntides  may  continue  for  some  time,  though  the  actions  of  the  luminaries \nshould  cease.", "e \ntides  may  continue  for  some  time,  though  the  actions  of  the  luminaries \nshould  cease. This  power  of  retaining  the  impressed  motion  lessens  the \ndifference  of  the  alternate  tides,  and  makes  those  tides  which  immediately \nsucceed  after  the  syzygies  greater,  and  those  which  follow  next  after  the \nquadratures  less.

But  farther;  the  propagation  of  the  tides  may  he  obstructed \neven  by  the  channels  of  the  ocean  itself,  when  they  are  not  of  depth  enough, \nfor  the  flood  happens  at  the  third  lunar  hour  in  the  Canary  islands ;  and \nat  all  those  western  coasts  that  lie  towards  the  Atlantic  ocean,  as  of  Ire \nland,  France,  Spain,  and  all  Africa,  to  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope,  except \nin  some  shallow  places,  where  it  is  impeded,  and  falls  out  later ;  and  in  the \nstraits  of  Gibraltar,  where,  by  reason  of  a  motion  propagated  from  the \nMediterranean  sea,  it  flows  sooner. But,  passing  from  those  coasts  over \nthe  breadth  of  the  ocean  to  the  coasts  of  America,  the  flood  arrives  first  at \nthe  most  eastern  shores  of  Brazil,  about  the  fourth  or  fifth  lunar  hour; \nthen  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  of  the  Amazons  at  the  sixth  hour,  but  at \nthe  neighbouring  islands  at  the  fourth  hour ;  afterwards  at  the  islands  of \nBermudas  at  the  seventh  hour,  and  at  port  St. An^nstin  in  Florida  at \nseven  and  a  half.", "ermudas  at  the  seventh  hour,  and  at  port  St. An^nstin  in  Florida  at \nseven  and  a  half. And  therefore  the  tide  is  propagated  through  the  ocean \nwith  a  slower  motion  than  it  should  be  according  to  the  course  of  the \nmoon ;  and  this  retardation  is  very  necessary,  that  the  sea  at  the  same  time \nmay  fall  between  Brazil  and  New  France,  and  rise  at  the  Canary  islands, \nand  on  the  coasts  of  Europe  and  Africa,  and  vice  versa :  for  the  sea  can \nnot  rise  in  one  place  but  by  falling  in  another. And  it  is  probable  that \nthe  Pacific  sea  is  agitated  by  the  same  laws :  for  in  the  coasts  of  Chili  and \nPeru  the  highest  flood  is  said  to  happen  at  the  third  lunar  hour. But \nwith  what  velocity  it  is  thence  propagated  to  the  eastern  coasts  of \nJapan,  the  Philippine  and  other  islands  adjacent  to  China,  I  have  not \nyet  learned. Farther;  it  may  happen  (p. 418)  that  the  tide  may  be  propagated  from \nthe  ocean  through  different  channels  towards  the  same  port,  and  may  pass \nquicker  through  some  channels  than  through  others,  in  which  case  the \nsame  tide,  divided  into  two  or  more  succeeding  one  another,  may  compound \nnew  motions  of  different  kinds.", "into  two  or  more  succeeding  one  another,  may  compound \nnew  motions  of  different  kinds. Let  us  suppose  one  tide  to  be  divided  into \ntwo  equal  tides,  the  former  whereof  precedes  the  other  by  the  space  of  six \nhours,  and  happens  at  the  third  or  twenty-seventh  hour  from  the  appulse \nof  the  moon  to  the  meridian  of  the  port. If  the  moon  at  the  time  of  this \nappulse  to  the  meridian  was  in  the  equator,  every  six  hours  alternately \nthere  would  arise  equal  floods,  which,  meeting  with  as  many  equal  ebbs, \nwould  so  balance  one  the  other,  that,  for  that  day,  the  water  wrould  stag \nnate,  and  remain  quiet. If  the  moon  then  declined  from  the  equator,  the \ntides  in  the  ocean  would  be  alternately  greater  and  less,  as  was  said;  and \nfrom  hence  two  greater  and  two  lesser  tides  would  be  alternately  propa \ngated  towards  that  port. But  the  two  greater  floods  would  make  the \ngreatest  height  of  the  waters  to  fall  out  in  the  middle  time  betwixt  both, \nand  the  Greater  and  lesser  floods  would  make  the  waters  to  rise  to  a  mean \n& \nheight  in  the  middle  time  between  them;  and  in  the  middle  time  between", "540  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. the  two  lesser  floods  the  waters  would  rise  to  their  least  height. Thus  in \nthe  space  of  twenty-four  hours  the  waters  would  come,  riot  twice,  but  once \nonly  to  their  greatest,  and  once  only  to  their  least  height ;  and  their  great \nest  height,  if  the  moon  declined  towards  the  elevated  pole,  would  happen \nat  the  sixth  or  thirtieth  hour  after  the  appulse  of  the  moon  to  the  meridian  \u2022 \nand  when  the  moon  changed  its  declination,  this  flood  would  be  changed \ninto  an  ebb.

In  that  port,  on  the \nday  which  follows  after  the  passage  of  the  moon  over  the  equator,  the \nwaters  stagnate ;  when  the  moon  declines  to  the  north,  they  begin  to  fluw \nand  ebb,  not  twice,  as  in  other  ports,  but  once  only  every  day  ;  and  the \nflood  happens  at  the  setting,  and  the  greatest  ebb  at  the  rising  of  the  moon. This  tide  increaseth  with  the  declination  of  the  moon  till  the  seventh  or \neighth  day ;  then  for  the  seventh  or  eighth  day  following  it  decreaseth  at \nthe  same  rate  as  it  had  increased  before,  and  ceaseth  when  the  moon \nchangeth  its  declination.", "e  rate  as  it  had  increased  before,  and  ceaseth  when  the  moon \nchangeth  its  declination. After  which  the  flood  is  immediately  changed \ninto  an  ebb ;  and  thenceforth  the  ebb  happens  at  the  setting  and  the  flood \nat  the  rising  of  the  moon,  till  the  moon  again  changes  its  declination. There  are  two  inlets  from  the  ocean  to  this  port;  one  more  direct  and  short \nbetween  the  island  Hainan  and  the  coast  of  QuanttiHg,  a  province  of \nChina  ;  the  other  round  about  between  the  same  island  and  the  coast  of \nCochim  ;  and  through  the  shorter  passage  the  tide  is  sooner  propagated  to \nBatsham. In  the  channels  of  rivers  the  influx  and  reflux  depends  upon  the  current \nof  the  rivers,  which  obstructs  the  ingress  of  the  waters  from  the  sea. and \npromotes  their  egress  to  the  sea,  making  the  ingress  later  and  slower,  and \nthe  egress  sooner  arid  faster;  and  hence  it  is  that  the  reflux  is  of  longer \nduration  that  the  influx,  especially  far  up  the  rivers,  where  the  force  of  the \nsea  is  less. So  Sturmy  tells  us,  that  in  the  river  Avon,  three  miles  below \nBristol,  the  water  flows  only  five  hours,  but  ebbs  seven  ;  and  without  doubt \nthe  difference  is  yet  greater  above  Bristol,  as  at  Carcs/iam  or  the  Bath.", "ithout  doubt \nthe  difference  is  yet  greater  above  Bristol,  as  at  Carcs/iam  or  the  Bath. This  difference  does  likewise  depend  upon  the  quantity  of  the  flux  and  re \nflux  ;  for  the  more  vehement  motion  of  the  sea  near  the  syzygies  of  the \nluminaries  more  easily  overcoming  the  resistance  of  the  rivers,  will  make \nthe  ingress  of  the  water  to  happen  sooner  and  to  continue  longer,  and  will \ntherefore  diminish  this  difference. But  while  the  moon  is  approaching  to \nthe  syzygies,  the  rivers  will  be  more  plentifully  filled,  their  currents  being \nobstructed  by  the  greatness  of  the  tides,  and  therefore  will  something  more \nretard  the  reflux  of  the  sea  a  little  after  than  a  little  before  the  syzygies. Upon  which  account  the  slowest  tides  of  all  will  not  happen  in  the  syzy- \n^ies,  but  precede  them  a  little ;  and  I  observed  above  that  the  tides  before \nthe  sy/ygies  were  also  retarded  by  the  force  of  the  sun ;  and  from  both", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 541 \ncauses  conjoined  the  retardation  of  the  tides  will  be  both  greater  and  sooner \nbefore  the  syzygies.

By  the  laws  we  have  been  describing,  the  times  of  the  tides  are  governed  ; \nbut  the  greatness  of  th-e  tides  depends  upon  the  greatness  of  the  seas.

Whence \nit  appears  that  the  tides  are  far  less  in  the  middle  of  the  sea  than  at  the \nshores ;  and  that  the  tides  at  the  shores  are  nearly  as  EF  (p. 451,  452),  the \nbreadth  of  the  sea  not  exceeding  a  quadrantal  arc.", "re  nearly  as  EF  (p. 451,  452),  the \nbreadth  of  the  sea  not  exceeding  a  quadrantal  arc. And  hence  it  is  that \nnear  the  equator,  where  the  sea  between  Africa  and  America  is  narrow, \nthe  tides  are  far  less  than  towards  either  side  in  the  temperate  zones,  wrhere \nthe  seas  are  extended  wider ;  or  on  almost  all  the  shores  of  the  Pacific  sea; \nas  well  towards  America  as  towards  China,,  and  within  as  well  as  without \nthe  tropics ;  and  that  in  islands  in  the  middle  of  the  sea  they  scarcely  rise \nhigher  than  two  or  three  feet,  but  on  the  shores  of  great  continents  are \nthree  or  four  times  greater,  and  above,  especially  if  the  motions  propagated \nfrom  the  ocean  are  by  degrees  contracted  into  a  narrow  space,  and  the  water, \nto  fill  and  empty  the  bays  alternately,  is  forced  to  flow  and  ebb  with  great \nviolence  through  shallow  places ;  as  Plymouth  and  Chepstow  Bridge  in \nEngland)  at  the  mount  of  >S*/.

And  these  are  the  forces  of  the  sun,  by  which  the \nmoon's  motions  are  disturbed. If  from  the  moon's  orbit  (p. 449V  we  descend  to  the  earth's  surface,  those \nforces  will  be  diminished  in  the  ratio  of  the  distances  60|  and  1 ;  and \ntherefore  the  force  LM  will  then  become  3S604600  times  less  than  the \nforce  of  gravity. But  this  force  acting  equally  every  where  upon  the \nearth,  will  scarcely  effect  any  change  on  the  motion  of  the  sea,  and  there \nfore  may  be  neglected  in  the  explication  of  that  motion.

At  the  mouth  of  the  river  Avon,  three  miles  below  Bristol  (p. 450  to \n453),  in  spring  and  autumn,  the  whole  ascent  of  the  water  in  the  conjunc \ntion  or  opposition  of  the  luminaries  (by  the  observation  of  Sturnty)  is \nabout  45  feet,  but  in  the  quadratures  only  25.", "ies  (by  the  observation  of  Sturnty)  is \nabout  45  feet,  but  in  the  quadratures  only  25. Because  the  apparent  di \nameters  of  the  luminaries  are  not  here  determined,  let  us  assume  them  in \ntheir  mean  quantities,  as  well  as  the  moon's  declination  in  the  equinoctial \nquadratures  in  its  mean  quantity,  that  is,  23|\u00b0  ;  and  the  versed  sine  of \ndouble  its  complement  will  be  1082,  supposing  the  radius  to  be  1000. But \nthe  declinations  of  the  sun  in  the  equinoxes  and  of  the  moon  in  the  syzy- \ngies  are  of  no  quantity,  and  the  versed  sines  of  double  the  complements \nare  each  2000.

And,  therefore,  mul- \n15138 \ntiplying  the  extremes   and  the  means,  we  have  5L  +  5S  =  TxTr   L<  \u2014 \nBut  farther  ;  I  remember  to  have  been  told  that  in  summer  the  ascent  of \nthe  sea  in  the  syzygies  is  to  the  ascent  thereof  in  the  quadratures  as  about \n5  to  4.", "he  sea  in  the  syzygies  is  to  the  ascent  thereof  in  the  quadratures  as  about \n5  to  4. In  the  solstices  themselves  it  is  probable  that  the  proportion  may \nbe  something  less,  as  about  6  to  5  ;  whence  it  would  follow  that  L  is  = \n5|S  [for  then  the  proportion  is          L  +  S  :  I,  \u2014  -S  :  :  6  :  5]. Till  we  can  more  certainly  determine  the  proportion  from  observation,  let \nus  assume  L  =  5^S  ;  and  since  the  heights  of  the  tides  are  as  the  forces \nwhich  excite  them,  and  the  force  of  the  sun  is  able  to  raise  the  tides  to  the \nheight  of  nine  inches,  the  moon's  force  will  be  sufficient  to  raise  the  same \nto  the  height  of  four  feet. And  if  we  allow  that  this  height  may  be \ndoubled,  or  perhaps  tripled,  by  that  force  of  reciprocation  which  we  observe \nin  the  motion  of  the  waters,  and  by  which  their  motion  once  be  ^un  is  kept \n35", "546  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. up  for  some  time,  there  will  be  force  enough  to  generate  all  that  quantity \nof  tides  which  we  really  find  in  the  ocean. Thus  we  have  seen  that  these  forces  are  sufficient  to  move  the  sea. But. so  far  as  I  can  observe,  they  will  not  be  able  to  produce  any  other  effect \nsensible  on  our  earth ;  for  since  the  weight  of  one  grain  in  4000  is  not \nsensible  in  the  nicest  balance :  and  the  sun's  force  to  move  the  tides  is \n12868200  less  than  the  force  of  gravity  ;  arid  the  sum  of  the  forces  of  both \nmoon  and  sun,  exceeding  the  sun's  force  only  in  the  ratio  of  6^  to  1,  is  still \n2032890  times  less  than  the  force  of  gravity  ;  it  is  evident  that  both  forces \ntogether  are  500  times  less  than  what  is  required  sensibly  to  increase  *  r \ndiminish  the  weight  of  any  body  in  a  balance. And,  therefore,  they  will \nnot  sensibly  move  any  suspended  body ;  nor  will  they  produce  any  sensible \neifect  on  pendulums,  barometers,  bodies  swimming  in  stagnant  water,  or  in \nthe  like  statical  experiments. In  the  atmosphere,  indeed,  they  will  excite \nsuch  a  flux  and  reflux  as  they  do  in  the  sea,  but  with  so  small  a  motion \nthat  no  sensible  wind  will  be  thence  produced.", "n  the  sea,  but  with  so  small  a  motion \nthat  no  sensible  wind  will  be  thence  produced. if  the  effects  of  both  moon  and  sun  in  raising  the  tides  (p. 454),  as  well \nas  their  apparent  diameters,  were  equal  among  themselves,  their  absolute \nforces  would  (by  Cor. XIV,  Prop. LXVI)  be  as  their  magnitudes. But  the \neffect  of  the  moon  is  to  the  effect  of  the  sun  as  about  5|  to  1 ;  and  the \nmoon's  diameter  less  than  the  sun's  in  the  ratio  of  31 1  to  32^,  or  of  45  to \n46. Now  the  force  of  the  moon  is  to  be  increased  in  the  ratio  of  the  effect \ndirectly,  and  in  the  triplicate  ratio  of  the  diameter  inversely. Whence  the \nforce  of  the  moon  compared  with  its  magnitude  will  be  to  the  force  of  the \nsun  compared  with  its  magnitude  in  the  ratio  compounded  of  5-^-  to  1,  and \nthe  triplicate  of  45  to  46  inversely,  that  is,  in  the  ratio  of  about  5^  to  1. And  therefore  the  moon,  in  respect  of  the  magnitude  of  its  body,  has  an \nabsolute  centripetal  force  greater  than  the  sun  in  respect  of  the  magnitude \nof  its  body  in  the  ratio  to  5T\\  to  1,  and  is  therefore  more  dense  in  the \nsame  ratio. In  the  time  of  27'1. 7h.", "to  5T\\  to  1,  and  is  therefore  more  dense  in  the \nsame  ratio. In  the  time  of  27'1. 7h. 43',  in  which  the  moon  makes  its  revolution  about \nthe  earth,  a  planet  may  be  revolved  about  the  sun  at  the  distance  of  18.95  1 \ndiameters  of  the  sun  from  the  sun's  centre,  supposing  the  mean  apparen \ndiameter  of  the  sun  to  be  32}' ;  and  in  the  same  time  the  moon  may  be  r\"- \nvolved  about  the  earth  at  rest,  at  the  distance  of  30  of  the  earth's  diame \nters. If  in  both  cases  the  number  of  diameters  was  the  same,  the  absolute \ncircum-terrestrial  force  would  (by  Cor. II,  Prop. LXXll)  be  to  the  absolute \ncircum-solar  force  as  the  magnitude  of  the  earth  to  the  magnitude  of  the \ntun. Because  the  number  of  the  earth's  diameters  is  greater  in  the  ratio \nof  30  to  18,954,  the  body  of  the  earth  will  be  less  in  the  triplicate  of  that \nratio,  that  is,  in  the  ratio  of  3||  to  1. Wherefore  the  earth's  force,  for  the \nmagnitude  of  its  body,  is  to  the  sun's  force,  for  the  magnitude  of  its  body, \nas  3f  f  to  1  :  and  consequently  the  earth's  density  to  the  sun's  will  be  IL", "THE    SYSTEM    OF     THE    WORLD  547 \nthe  same  ratio. Since,  then,  the  moon's  density  is  to  the  sun's  density  as \n5JS  to  I,  the  moon's  density  will  be  to  the  earth's  density  as  5r\\  to  3f  {, \nor  as  23  to  16. Wh. veforc  since  the  moon's  magnitude  is  to  the  earth's \nmagnitude  as  about  I  to  4l\u00a3,  the  moon's  absolute  centripetal  force  will  be \nto  the  earth's  absolute  centripetal  force  as  about  I  to  29,  and  the  quantity \nof  matter  in  the  moon  to  the  quantity  of  matter  in  the  earth  in  the  same- \nratio.

As  to  the \nfixed  stars,  the  smallness  of  their  annual  parallax  proves  them  to  be  re \nmoved  to  immense  distances  from  the  system  of  the  planets:  that  this \nparallax  is  less  than  one  minute  is  most  certain  ;  and  from  thence  it  follows \nthat  the  distance  of  the  fixed  stars  is  above  360  times  greater  than  the \ndistance  of  Saturn  from  ;he  sun. Such  as  reckon  the  earth  one  of  the \nplanets,  and  the  sun  one  of  the  fixed  stars,  may  remove  the  fixed  stars  to \nyet  greater  distances  by  the  following  arguments:  from  the  annual  motion \nof  the  earth  there  would  happen  an  apparent  transposition  of  the  fixed \nstars,  one  in  respect  of  another,  almost  equal  to  their  double  parallax:  but \nthe  greater  and  nearer  stars,  in  respect  of  the  more  remote,  which  are  only \nseen  by  the  telescope,  have  not  hitherto  been  observed  to  have  the  least \nmotion. If  we  should  suppose  that  motion  to  be  but  less  than  20\",  the \ndistance  of  the  nearer  fixed  stars  would  exceed  the  mean  distance  of  Saturn \nby  above  2000  times.", "the  nearer  fixed  stars  would  exceed  the  mean  distance  of  Saturn \nby  above  2000  times. Again:  the  disk  of  Saturn,  which  is  only  17\"  or \n18\"  in  diameter,  receives  but  about  ^----'--^.^  of  the  sun's  light;  for  so \nmuch  less  is  that  disk  than  the  whole  spherical  surface  of  the  orb  of  Saturn. Now  if  we  suppose  Saturn  to  rellec*  about  {  of  this  light,  the  whole  light \nreflected  from  its  illuminated  hemisphere  will  be  about  T ^ ^Wo  o\"^\u00ab~  \u00b0^  ^e \nwhole  light  emitted  from  the  sun's  hemisphere:  and,  therefore,  since  light \nis  rarefied  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  distance  from  the  luminous  body,  if \nthe  sun  was  10000  v/42  times  more  distant  than  Saturn,  it  would  yet  ap \npear  as  lucid  as  Saturn  now  does  without  its  ring,  that  is,  something  more \nlucid  than  a  fixed  star  of  the  first  magnitude. Let  us,  therefore,  suppose \nthat  the  distance  from  which  the  sun  would  shine  as  a  fixed  star  exceeds \nthat  of  Saturn  by  about  100,000  times,  and  its  apparent  diameter  will  be \n7V. 16vi. and  its  parallax  arising  from  the  annual  motion  of  the  earth  13\"\"  : \nand  so  great  will  be  the  distance,  the  apparent  diameter,  and  the  parallax \nof  the  fixed  stars  of  the  first  magnitude,  in  bulk  and  light  equal  to  our  sun.", "4>i  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. Some  may,  perhaps,  imagine  that  a  great  part  of  the  light  of  the  fixed  stars \nis  intercepted  and  lost  in  its  passage  through  so  vast  spaces,  and  upon  that \naccount  pretend  to  place  the  fixed  stars  at  nearer  distances;  but  at  this \nrate  the  remoter  stars  could  be  scarcely  seen. Suppose,  for  example,  that \n\u00a3  of  the  light  perish  in  its  passage  from  the  nearest  fixed  stars  to  us ;  then \n|  will  twice  perish  in  its  passage  through  a  double  space,  thrice  through  a \ntriple,  and  so  forth.

And,  by  the  same  argument,  the  fixed  stars  at  a \ntriple  distance  will  be  9  X  4.

For  all  the  comets  which  move  in  a  direct  course,  according  to \nthe  order  of  the  signs,  about  the  end  of  their  appearance  become  more  than \nordinarily  slow,  or  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun  ; \nand  more  than  ordinarily  swift  if  the  earth  is  approaching  to  a  heliocen \ntric  opposition  with  them. Whereas,  on  the  other  hand,  those  which  move \nagainst  the  order  of  the  signs,  towards  the  end  of  their  appearance,  appear \nswifter  than  they  ought  to  be  if  the  earth  is  between  them  and  the  sun  ; \nand  slower,  and  perhaps  retrograde,  if  the  earth  is  in  the  other  side  of  its \ncrbit. This  is  occasioned  by  the  motion  of  the  earth  in  different  situa \ntions.", "of  its \ncrbit. This  is  occasioned  by  the  motion  of  the  earth  in  different  situa \ntions. If  the  earth  go  the  same  way  with  the  comet,  with  a  swifter \nmotion,  the  comet  becomes  retrograde;  if  with  a  slower  motion,  the  comet \nbecomes  slower,  however  ;  and  if  the  earth  move  the  contrary  way,  it  be \ncomes  swifter ;  and  by  collecting  the  differences  between  the  slower  and \nswifter  motions,  and  the  sums  of  the  more  swift  and  retrograde  motions, \nand  comparing  them  with  the  situation  and  motion  of  the  earth  from, \nwhence  they  arise,  I  found,  by  means  of  this  parallax,  that  the  distances \nof  the  comets  at  the  time  they  cease  to  be  visible  to  the  naked  eye  are \nalways  less  than  the  distance  of  Saturn,  and  generally  even  less  than  the \ndistance  of  Jupiter. The  same  thing  may  be  collected  from  the  curvature  of  the  way  of  the \ncomets  (p. 462). These  bodies  go  on  nearly  in  great  circles  while  their \nmotion  continues  swift ;  but  about  the  end  of  their  course,  when  that  part", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 549 \nof  their  apparent  motion  which  arises  from  the  parallax  bears  a  greater \nproportion  to  their  whole  apparent  motion,  they  commonly  deviate  from \nthose  circles ;  and  when  the  earth  goes  to  one  side,  they  deviate  to  the \nother  ;  and  this  deflection,  because  of  its  corresponding  with  the  motion \nof  the  earth,  must  arise  chiefly  from  the  parallax ;  and  the  quantity  there \nof  is  so  considerable,  as,  by  my  computation,  to  place  the  disappearing \ncomets  a  good  deal  lower  than  Jupiter. Whence  it  follows,  that,  when \nthey  approach  nearer  to  us  in  their  perigees  and  perihelions,  they  often  de \nscend  below  the  orbits  of  Mars  and  the  inferior  planets. Moreover,  this  nearness  of  the  cornets  is  confirmed  by  the  annual  paral \nlax  of  the  orbit,  in  so  far  as  the  same  is-  pretty  nearly  collected  by  the \nsupposition  that  the  comets  move  uniformly  in  right  lines. The  method \nof  collecting  the  distance  of  a  comet  according  to  this  hypothesis  from \nfour  observations  (first  attempted  by  Kepler,  and  perfected  by  Dr. Wallis \nand  Sir  Christopher  Wren)  is  well  known  \u2022  and  the  comets  reduced  to \nthis  regularity  generally  pass  through  the  middle  of  the  planetary  region.", "s  reduced  to \nthis  regularity  generally  pass  through  the  middle  of  the  planetary  region. So  the  comets  of  the  year  1607  and  1618,  as  their  motions  are  defined  by \nKepler,  passed  between  the  sun  and  the  earth  :  that  of  the  year  16  '4  be \nlow  the  orbit  of  Mars;  and  that  in  1680  below  the  orbit  of  Mercury,  as \nits  motion  was  defined  by  Sir  Christopher  Wren  rind  others. By  a  like \nrectilinear  hypothesis,  Hevelius  placed  all  the  comets  about  which  we  have \nany  observations  below  the  orbit  of  Jupiter. It  is  a  false  notion,  there \nfore,  and  contrary  to  astronomical  calculation,  which  some  have  enter \ntained,  who,  from  the  regular  motion  of  the  comets,  either  remove  them \ninto  the  regions  of  the  fixed  stars,  or  deny  the  motion  of  the  earth  :  where \nas  their  motions  cannot  be  reduced  to  perfect  regularity,  unless  we  suppose \nthem  to  pass  through  the  regions  near  the  earth  in  motion  ;  and  these  are \nthe  arguments  drawn  from  the  parallax,  so  far  as  it  can  be  determined \nwithout  an  exact  knowledge  of  the  orbits  and  motions  of  the  comets. The  near  approach  of  the  comets  is  farther  confirmed  from  the  light  of \ntheir  heads  (p.", "he  near  approach  of  the  comets  is  farther  confirmed  from  the  light  of \ntheir  heads  (p. 463,  465) ;  for  the  light  of  a  celestial  body,  illuminated  by \nthe  sun,  and  receding  to  remote  parts,  is  diminished  in  the  quadruplicate \nproportion  of  the  distance ;  to  wit,  in  one  duplicate  proportion  on  account \nof  the  increase  of  the  distance  from  the  sun  ;  and  in  another  duplicate \nproportion  on  account  of  the  decrease  of  the  apparent  diameter. Hence  it \nmay  be  inferred,  that  Saturn  being  at  a  double  distance,  and  having  its \napparent  diameter  nearly  half  of  that  of  Jupiter,  must  appear  about  I  (5 \ntimes  more  obscure ;  and  that,  if  its  distance  were  4  times  greater,  its \nlight  would  be  256  times  less ;  and  therefore  would  be  hardly  perceivable \nto  the  naked  eye. But  now  the  comets  often  equal  Saturn's  light,  without \nexceeding  him  in  their  apparent  diameters. So  the  comet  of  the  year \n1668,  according  to  Dr. Hooke's  observations,  equalled  in  brightness  the \nlight  of  a  fixed  star  of  the  first  magnitude ;  and  its  head,  or  the  star  ID", "550  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. the  middle  of  the  coma,  appeared,  through  a  telescope  oi  15  feet,  as  lucid \nas  Saturn  near  the  horizon  ;  but  the  diameter  of  the  head  was  only  25\" \nthat  is,  almost  the  same  with  the  diameter  of  a  circle  equal  to  Saturn \nand  his  ring. The  coma  or  hair  surrounding  the  head  was  about  ten  times \nas  broad;  namely,  4\u00a3  min. Again  ;  the  least  diameter  of  the  hair  of  the \ncomet  of  the  year  1682,  observed  by  Mr. 'Flamsted  with  a  tube  of  16  feet \nand  measured  with  the  micrometer,  was  2'  0''  ;  but  the  nucleus,  or  star  in \nthe  middle,  scarcely  possessed  the  tenth  part  of  this  breadth,  and  was \ntherefore  only  11'''  or  12\"  broad;  but  the  light  and  clearness  of  its  head \nexceeded  that  of  the  year  1680,  and  was  equal  to  that  of  the  stars  of  the \nfirst  or  second  magnitude. Moreover,  the  comet  of  the  year  1665,  in  April, \nas  Hevelws  informs  us,  exceeded  almost  all  the  fixed  stars  in  splendor,  arid \neven  Saturn  itself,  as  being  of  a  much  more  vivid  colour ;  for  this  comet \nwas  more  lucid  than  that  which  appeared  at  the  end  of  the  foregoing  year \nand  was  compared  to  the  stars  of  the  first  magnitude.", "the  end  of  the  foregoing  year \nand  was  compared  to  the  stars  of  the  first  magnitude. The  diameter  of \nthe  coma  was  about  6'  ;  but  the  nucleus,  compared  with  the  planets  by \nmeans  of  a  telescope,  was  plainly  less  than  Jupiter,  and  was  sometime*? thought  less,  sometimes  equal  to  the  body  of  Saturn  within  the  ring. To \nthis  breadth  add  that  of  the  ring,  and  the  whole  face  of  Saturn  will  be \ntwice  as  great  as  that  of  the  comet,  with  a  light  not  at  all  more  intense  ; \nand  therefore  the  comet  was  nearer  to  the  sun  than  Saturn. From  the \nproportion  of  the  nucleus  to  the  whole  head  found  by  these  observations, \nand  from  its  breadth,  which  seldom  exceeds  8'  or  12;,  it  appears  that  thi- \nBtars  of  the  comets  are  most  commonly  of  the  same  apparent  magnitude \nas  the  planets  ;  but  that  their  light  may  be  compared  oftentimes  with  that \nof  Saturn,  and  sometimes  exceeds  it. And  hence  it  is  certain  that  in  their \nperihelia  their  distances  can  scarcely  be  greater  than  that  of  Saturn.", "n  that  in  their \nperihelia  their  distances  can  scarcely  be  greater  than  that  of  Saturn. At \ntwice  that  distance,  the  light  would  be  four  times  less,  which  besides  by  its \ndim  paleness  would  be  as  much  inferior  to  the  light  of  Saturn  as  the  light \nof  Saturn  is  to  the  splendor  of  Jupiter  :  but  this  difference  would  be  easily \nobserved. At  a  distance  ten  times  greater,  their  bodies  must  be  greattr \nthan  that  of  the  sun ;  but  their  light  would  be  100  times  fainter  than \nthat  of  Saturn. And  at  distances  still  greater,  their  bodies  would  far \nexceed  the  sun  ;. but,  being  in  such  dark  regions,  they  must  be  no  longer \nvisible. So  impossible  is  it  to  place  the  comets  in  the  middle  regions  be \ntween  the  sun  and  fixed  stars,  accounting  the  sun  as  one  of  the  fixed  stars: \nfor  certainly  they  would  receive  no  more  light  there  from  the  sun  than  w<? do  from  the  greatest  of  the  fixed  stars. So  far 'we  have  gone  without  considering  that  obscuration  which  comets \nsuffer  from  that  plenty  of  thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads.", "ion  which  comets \nsuffer  from  that  plenty  of  thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads. and  through  which  the  heads  always  shew  dull  as  through  a  cloud  ;  for \nby  how  much  the  more  a  body  is  obscured  by  this  smoke,  by  so  much  th.2 \nmore  near  it  must  be  allowed  to  come  to  the  sun,  that  it  may  vie  with  the", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 651 \nplanets  in  the  quantity  of  light  which  it  reflects  :  whence  it  is  probable \nthat  the  comets  descend  far  below  the  orbit  of  Saturn,  as  we  proved  before \nfrom  their  parallax. But,  above  all,  the  thing  is  evinced  from  their  tails, \nwhich  must  be  owing  either  to  the  sun's  light  reflected  from  a  srnoke \narising  from  them,  and  dispersing  itself  through  the  aether,  or  to  the  light \nuf  their  own  headt. In  the  former  case  we  must  shorten  the  distance  of  the  comets,  lest  we  be \nobliged  to  allow  that  the  smoke  arising  from  their  heads  is  propagated \nthrough  such  a  vast  extent  of  space,  and  with  such  a  velocity  of  expansion, \njus  will  seem  altogether  incredible;  in  the  latter  case  the  whole  light  of \nboth  head  and  tail  must  be  ascribed  to  the  central  nucleus. But,  then,  if \nwe  suppose  all  this  light  to  be  united  and  condensed  within  the  disk  of  the \nnucleus,  certainly  the  nucleus  will  by  far  exceed  Jupiter  itself  in  splendor, \nespecially  when  it  emits  a  very  large  and  lucid  tail. If,  therefore,  under  a  less \napparent  diameter,  it  reflects  more  light,  it  must  be  much  more  illuminated \nby  the  sun,  and  therefore  much  nearer  to  it. So  the  comet  that  appeared \nDec.", "luminated \nby  the  sun,  and  therefore  much  nearer  to  it. So  the  comet  that  appeared \nDec. }2  and  15,  O.S. Anno  1679,  at  the  time  it  emitted  a  very  shining \ntail,  whose  splendor  was  equal  to  that  of  many  stars  like  Jupiter,  if  their \nlight  were  dilated  and  spread  through  so  great  a  space,  was,  as  to  the  mag \nnitude  of  its  nucleus,  less  than  Jupiter  (as  Mr. Flaw  sled  observed),  and \ntherefore  was  much  nearer  to  the  sun :  nay,  it  was  even  less  than  Mercury. For  on  the  17th  of  that  month,  when  it  was  nearer  to  the  earth,  it  ap \npeared  to  Cassini  through  a  telescope  of  35  feet  a  little  less  than  the  globe \nof  Saturn. On  the  8th  of  this  month,  in  the  morning,  Dr. ffalfey  saw  the \ntail,  appearing  broad  and  very  short,  and  as  if  it  rose  from  the  body  of  the \nsun  itself,  at  that  time  very  near  its  rising. Its  form  was  like  that  of  an \nextraordinary  bright  cloud ;  nor  did  it  disappear  till  the  sun  itself  began \nto  be  seen  above  the  horizon. Its  splendor,  therefore,  exceeded  the  light  of \nthe  clouds  till  the  sun  rose,  and  far  surpassed  that  of  all  the  stars  together, \nas  yielding  only  to  the  immediate  brightness  of  the  sun  itself.", "ll  the  stars  together, \nas  yielding  only  to  the  immediate  brightness  of  the  sun  itself. Neither \nMercury,  nor  Venus,  nor  the  moon  itself,  are  seen  so  near  the  rising  sun. Imagine  all  this  dilated  light  collected  together,  and  to  be  crowded  into \nthe  orbit  of  the  comet's  nucleus  which  was  less  than  Mercury ;  by  its \nsplendor,  thus  increased,  becoming  so  much  more  conspicuous,  it  will  vastly \nexceed  Mercury,  and  therefore  must  be  nearer  to  the  sun. On  the  12th \nand  15th  of  the  same  month,  this  tail,  extending  itself  over  a  much  greater \nspace,  appeared  more  rare;  but  its  light  was  still  so  vigorous  as  to  become \nvisible  when  the  fixed  stars  were  hardly  to  be  seen,  and  soon  after  to  appear \nlike  a  fiery  beam  shining  in  a  wonderful  manner. From  its  length,  which \nwas  40  or  50  degrees,  and  its  breadth  of  2  degrees,  we  may  compute  what \nthe  light  of  the  whole  must  be \nThis  near  approach  of  the  comets  to  the  sun  is  confirmed  from  the  situ- \ntion  they  are  seen  in  when  their  tails  appear  most  resplendent;  for  when", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. the  head  passes  by  the  sun,  and  lies  hid  under  the  solar  rays,  very  bright \nand  shining  ta  Is,  like  fiery  beams,  are  said  to  issue  from  the  horizon;  but \nafterwards,  when  the  head  begins  to  appear,  and  is  got  farther  from  the \nsun,  that  splendor  always  decreases,  and  turns  by  degrees  into  a  paleness \nlike  to  that  of  the  milky  way,  but  much  more  sensible  at  first ;  after  that \nvanishing  gradually. Such  was  that  most  resplendent  comet  described  by \nAristotle,  Lib. 1,  Meteor. 6. \"  The  head  thereof  could  not  be  seen,  because \nit  set  before  the  sun,  or  at  least  was  hid  under  the  sun's  rays ;  but  the  next \nday  it  was  seen  as  well  as  might  be ;  for,  having  left  the  sun  but  a  very \nlittle  way,  it  set  immediately  after  it ;  and  the  scattered  light  of  the  head \nobscured  by  the  too  great  splendour  (of  the  tail)  did  not  yet  appear. But \nafterwards  (says  Aristotle),  when  the  splendour  of  the  tail  was  now  dimin \nished  (the  head  of),  the  comet  recovered  its  native  brightness.

From  the  situation  of  the  tail  of  this  comet,  and  the  time  of  its \nfirst  appearance,  we  may  infer  that  the  head  was  then  near  the  sun,  and \nwent  farther  from  him  every  day ;  for  that  comet  continued  three  months. In  the  year  1527,  Aug. 11,  about  four  in  the  morning,  there  was  seen  al \nmost  throughout  Europe  a  terrible  comet  in  Leo,  which  continued  flaming \nan  hour  and  a  quarter  every  day. It  rose  from  the  east,  and  ascended  to \nthe  south  and  west  to  a  prodigious  length.", "ay. It  rose  from  the  east,  and  ascended  to \nthe  south  and  west  to  a  prodigious  length. It  was  most  conspicuous  to  the \nnorth,  and  its  cloud  (that  is,  its  tail)  was  very  terrible ;  having,  according \nto  the  fancies  of  the  vulgar,  the  form  of  an  arm  a  little  bent  holding  a \nsword  of  a  vast  magnitude. In  the  year  1618,  in  the  end  of  November, \nthere  began  a  rumour,  that  there  appeared  about  sun-rising  a  bright  beam, \nwhich  was  the  tail  of  a  comet  whose  head  was  yet  concealed  within  the \nbrightness  of  the  solar  rays. On  Nov. 24,  and  from  that  time,  the  comet \nitself  appeared  with  a  bright  light,  its  head  and  tail  being  extremely  re \nsplendent. The  length  of  the  tail,  which  was  at  first  20  or  30  dog.,  in \ncreased  till  December  9,  when  it  arose  to  75  deg,,  but  with  a  light  much \nmore  faint  and  dilute  than  at  the  beginning. In  the  year  1668,  March  5, \nN. S.,  about  7  in  the  evening,  P. Volent. Estaucius,  being  in  Brazil,  saw \na  comet  near  the  horizon  in  the  south-west. Its  head  was  small,  and \nscarcely  discernible,  but  its  tail  extremely  bright  and  refulgent,  so  that  the \nreflection  of  it  from  the  sea  was  easily  seen  by  those  who  stood  upon  the \nshore.", "the \nreflection  of  it  from  the  sea  was  easily  seen  by  those  who  stood  upon  the \nshore. This  great  splendor  lasted  but  three  days,  decreasing  very  remark \nably  from  that  time. The  tail  at  the  beginning  extended  itself  from  west \nto  south,  and  in  a  situation  almost  parallel  to  the  horizon,  appearing  like \na  shining  beam  23  deg. in  length. Afterwards,  the  light  decreasing,  its \nmagnitude  increased  till  the  comet  ceased  to  be  visible;  so  that  Cassiid, \nat  Bologna^  saw  it  (Mar. 10,  11,  12)  rising  from  the  horizon  32  deg. in \nlength. In  Portugal  it  is  said  to  have  taken  up  a  fourth  part  of  the \nheavens  (that  is,  45  deg.),  extending  itself  from  west  to  east  with  a  notable \nbrightness ;  though  the  whole  of  it  was  not  seen,  because  the  head  in  this \npart  of  the  world  always  lay  hid  below  the  horizon. From  the  increase  of \nthe  tail  it  is  plain  that  the  head  receded  from  the  sun. and  was  nearest  to \nit  at  the  beginning,  when  the  tail  appeared  brightest. To  all  these  we  may  add  the  comet  of  1680,  whose  wonderful  splendor \nat  the  conjunction  of  the  head  with  the  sun  was  above  described.

Lastly,  the  same  thing  is  inferred  (p. 466;  407)  from  the  light  of  the \nheads  increasing  in  the  recess  of  the  comets  from  the  earth  towards  the \nsun,  and  decreasing  in  their  return  from  the  sun  towards  the  earth ;  for  so \nthe  last  comet  of  the  year  1 665  (by  the  observation  of  Hevelius]^  from  the \ntime  that  it  was  first  seen,  was  always  losing  of  its  apparent  motion,  and \ntherefore  had  already  passed  its  perigee :  yet  the  splendor  of  its  head  was \ndaily  increasing,  till,  being  hid  by  the  sun?s  rays,  the  comet  ceased  to  ap \npear.

I3ut  from  that  time  its  diurnal  motion  was  continually  upon  the \nincrease  till  Septe/uber  4,  when  it  arose  to  about  5  degrees  ;  and  therefore \nin  all  this  interval  of  time  the  comet  was  approaching  to  the  earth.

The \ncomet  of  the  year  1618,  about  the  middle  of  December,  and  that  of  the \nyear  1680,  about  the  end  of  the  same  month,  did  both  move  with  their \ngreatest  velocity,  and  were  therefore  then  in  their  perigees  :  but  the  greatest \nsplendor  of  their  heads  was  seen  two  weeks  before,  when  they  had  just  got \nclear  of  the  sun's  rays  :  and  the  greatest  splendor  of  their  tuild  a  little \nmore  early,  when  yet  nearer  to  the  sun. The  head  of  the  former  comet, \naccording  to  the  observations  of  Cysattis,  Dec. 1,  appeared  greater  than \nthe  stars  of  the  first  magnitude:  and,  Dec. 16  (being  then  in  its  perigee), \n\u2022)i  a  small  magnitude,  and  the  splendor  or  clearness  was  much  diminished.

If  we  take  equal \ntimes  on  each  hand  of  the  perigee,  the  heads  placed  at  remote  distances \nwould  have  shined  equally  before  and  after,  because  of  their  equal  distances \nfrjin  the  earth. That  in  one  case  they  shined  very  bright,  and  in  the \nother  vanished,  is  to  be  ascribed  to  the  nearness  cf  the  sun  in  the  first  case, \nand  his  distance  in  the  other;  and  from  the  great  difference  of  the  light \nin  these  two  cases  we  infer  its  great  nearness  in  the  first  of  them  :  for \nthe  light  of  the  comets  uses  to  be  regular,  and  to  appear  greatest  when \ntheir  heads  move  the  swiftest,  and  are  therefore  in  their  perigees  ;  except \ning  in  so  fur  as  it  is  increased  by  their  nearness  to  the  sun.

If  they  were  to  be  seen  in  the  regions  a  great  way \nbeyond  Saturn,  they  must  appear  oftener  in  these  parts  of  the  heavens \nthat  are  opposite  to  the  sun  ;  for  those  which  are  in  that  situation  would \nbe  nearer  to  the  earth,  and  the  interposition  of  the  sun  would  obscure  the \nothers:  but,  looking  over  the  history  of  comets,  I  find  that  four  or  five \ntimes  more  have  been  seen  in  the  hemisphere  towards  the  sun  than  in  th-3 \nopposite  hemisphere  ;  besides,  without  doubt,  not  a  few  which  have  been \nhid  by  the  light  of  the  sun ;  fur  comets  descending  into  our  parts  neither \nemit  tails,  nor  are  so  well  illuminated  by  the  sun,  as  to  discover  them \nselves  to  our  naked  eyes,  till  they  are  come  nearer  to  us  than  Jupiter.", "discover  them \nselves  to  our  naked  eyes,  till  they  are  come  nearer  to  us  than  Jupiter. But \nthe  far  greater  part  of  that  spherical  space,  which  is  described  about  the \nsun  with  so  small  an  interval,  lies  en  that  side  of  the  earth  which  regards \nthe  sun,  and  the  comets  in  that  greater  part  are  more  strongly  illuminated, \nas  being  for  the  most  part  nearer  to  the  sun  :  besides,  from  the  remarka \nble  eccentricity  of  their  orbits,  it  comes  to  pass  that  their  lower  apsides \nare  much  nearer  to  the  sun  than  if  their  revolutions  were  performed  in \ncircles  concentric  to  the  sun. Hence  also  we  understand  why  the  tails  of  the  comets,  while  their  heads \nare  descending  towards  the  sun,  always  appear  short  and  rare,  and  are  sel \ndom  said  to  have  exceeded  15  or  20  deg. in  length  ;  but  in  the  recess  of \nthe  heads  from  the  sun  often  shine  like  fiery  beams,  and  soon  after  reach \nto  40,  50,  60,  70  deg. in  length,  or  more. This  great  splendor  and  length \nof  the  tails  arises  from  the  heat  which  the  sun  communicates  to  the  comet \nas  it  passes  near  it. And  thence,  I  think,  it  may  be  concluded,  that  all  the \ncomets  that  have  had  such  tails  have  passed  very  near  the  sun.", "oncluded,  that  all  the \ncomets  that  have  had  such  tails  have  passed  very  near  the  sun. Hence  also  we  may  collect  that  the  tails  arise  from  the  atmospheres  of \nthe  heads  (p. 487  to  488) :  but  we  have  had  three  several  opinions  about \nthe  tails  of  comets ;  for  some  will  have  it  that  they  are  nothing  else  but \nthe  beams  of  the  sun's  light  transmitted  through  the  comets'  heads,  which \nthey  suppose  to  be  transparent ;  others,  that  they  proceed  from  the  refrac \ntion  which  light  suffers  in  passing  from  the  comet's  head  to  the  earth ;", "55fi  THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. and,  lastly,  others,  that  they  are  a  sort  of  clouds  or  vapour  constantly \nrising  from  the  cornets'  heads,  and  tending  towards  the  parts  opposite  to \nthe  sun. The  first  is  the  opinion  of  such  as  are  yet  unacquainted  with \noptics ;  for  the  beams  of  the  sun  are  not  seen  in  a  darkened  room,  but  in \nconsequence  of  the  light  that  is  reflected  from  them  by  the  little  particles \nof  dust  and  smoke  which  are  always  flying  about  in  the  air ;  and  hence  it \nis  that  in  air  impregnated  with  thick  smoke  they  appear  with  greater \nbrightness,  and  are  more  faintly  and  more  difficultly  seen  in  a  finer  air; \nbut  in  the  heavens,  where  there  is  no  matter  to  reflect  the  light,  they  are \nnot  to  be  seen  at  all.", "ens,  where  there  is  no  matter  to  reflect  the  light,  they  are \nnot  to  be  seen  at  all. Light  is  not  seen  as  it  is  in  the  beams,  but  as  it  is \nthence  reflected  to  our  eyes ;  for  vision  is  not  made  but  by  rays  falling \nupon  the  eyes,  and  therefore  there  must  be  some  reflecting  matter  in  those \nparts  where  the  tails  of  comets  are  seen  ;  and  so  the  argument  turns  upon \nthe  third  opinion  ;  for  that  reflecting  matter  can  be  no  where  found  but  in \nthe  place  of  the  tail,  because  otherwise,  since  all  the  celestial  spaces  are \nequally  illuminated  by  the  sun's  light,  no  part  of  the  heavens  could  appear \nwith  more  splendor  than  another. The  second  opinion  is  liable  to  many \ndifficulties. The  tails  of  comets  are  never  seen  variegated  with  thos-e \ncolours  which  ever  use  to  be  inseparable  from  refraction  ;  and  the  distinct \ntransmission  of  the  light  of  the  fixed  stars  and  planets  to  us  is  a  demon \nstration  that  the  aether  or  celestial  medium  is  not  endowed  with  any  re \nfractive  power.", "tration  that  the  aether  or  celestial  medium  is  not  endowed  with  any  re \nfractive  power. For  as  to  what  is  alledged  that  the  fixed  stars  have  been \nsometimes  seen  by  the  Egyptians  environed  with  a  coma  or  capillitium \nbecause  that  has  but  rarely  happened,  it  is  rather  to  be  ascribed  to  a  casual \nrefraction  of  clouds,  as  well  as  the  radiation  and  scintillation  of  the  fixed \nstars  to  the  refractions  both  of  the  eyes  and  air ;  for  upon  applying  a  tele \nscope  to  the  eye,  those  radiations  and  scintillations  immediately  disappear. By  the  tremulous  agitation  of  the  air  and  ascending  vapours,  it  happens \nthat  the  rays  of  light  are  alternately  turned  aside  from  the  narrow  space \nof  the  pupil  of  the  eye ;  but  no  such  thing  can  have  place  in  the  much \nwider  aperture  of  the  object-glass  of  a  telescope ;  and  hence  it  is  that  a \nscintillation  is  occasioned  in  the  former  case  which  ceases  in  the  latter ; \nand  this  cessation  in  the  latter  case  is  a  demonstration  of  the  regular  trans \nmission  of  light  through  the  heavens  without  any  sensible  refraction.", "the  regular  trans \nmission  of  light  through  the  heavens  without  any  sensible  refraction. But,  to  obviate  an  objection  that  may  be  made  from  the  appearing  of  no \ntail  in  such  comets  as  shine  but  with  a  faint  light,  as  if  the  secondary \nrays  were  then  too  weak  to  affect  the  eyes,  and  for  this  reason  it  is  that \nthe  tails  of  the  fixed  stars  do  not  appear,  we  are  to  consider  that  by  the \nmeans  of  telescopes  the  light  of  the  fixed  stars  may  be  augmented  above \nan  hundred  fold  and  yet  no  tails  are  seen;  that  the  light  of  the  planets  is \nyet  more  copious  without  any  tail,  but  that  comets  are  seen  sometimes \nwith  huge  tails  when  the  light  of  their  heads  is  but  faint  and  dull ;  for \nso  it  happened  in  the  comet  of  the  year  1680,  when  in  the  month  of  De-", "THE    SYSTEM    OF    THE    WORLD. 557 \ncember  it  was  scarcely  equal  in  light  to  the  stars  of  the  second  magnitude \nand  yet  emitted  a  notable  tail,  extending  to  the  length  of  40\u00b0,  50\u00b0,  60\u00b0. or \n70\u00b0,  and  upwards ;  and  afterwards,  on  the  27th  and  28th  of  January,  the \nhead  appeared  but  as  a  star  of  the  seventh  magnitude ;  but  the  tail  (as \nwas  said  above),  with  a  light  that  was  sensible  enough,  though  faint,  was \nstretched  out  to  6  or  7  degrees  in  length,  and  with  a  languishing  light \nthat  was  more  difficultly  seen,  even  to  12\u00b0  and  upwards. But  on  the  9th \nand  10th  of  February,  when  to  the  naked  eye  the  head  appeared  no  more, \nI  saw  through  a  telescope  the  tail  of  2\u00b0  in  length. But  farther :  if  the \ntail  was  owing  to  the  refraction  of  the  celestial  matter,  and  did  deviate \nfrom  the  opposition  of  the  sun,  according  as  the  figure  of  the  heavens  re \nquires,  that  deviation,  in  the  same  places  of  the  heavens,  should  be  always \ndirected  towards  the  same  parts  :  but  the  comet  of  the  year  1680,  Decem \nber  28'1.

M. at  London,  was  seen  in  Pisces,  8\u00b0  41',  with  latitude \nnorth  28\u00b0  6',  while  the  sun  was  in  Capricorn  18\u00b0  26'.", "Pisces,  8\u00b0  41',  with  latitude \nnorth  28\u00b0  6',  while  the  sun  was  in  Capricorn  18\u00b0  26'. And  the  comet  of \nthe  year  1577,  December  29,  was  in  Pisces  8\u00b0  41',  with  latitude  north \n2SD  40'  ;  and  the  sun,  as  before,  in  about  Capricorn  18\u00b0  26'. In  both \ncases  the  situation  of  the  earth  was  the  same,  and  the  comet  appeared  in \nthe  same  place  of  the  heavens  ;  yet  in  the  former  case  the  tail  of  the  comet \n(as  well  by  my  observations  as  by  the  observations  of  others)  deviated \nfrom  the  opposition  of  the  sun  towards  the  north  by  an  angle  of  4|  de \ngrees,  whereas  in  the  latter  there  was  (according  to  the  observation  of \nTycht]  a  deviation  of  21  degrees  towards  the  south. The  refraction, \ntherefore,  of  the  heavens  being  thus  disproved,  it  remains  that  the  phaeno- \nmeria  of  the  tails  of  comets  must  be  derived  from  some  reflecting  matter.

It  is  well  known  that  the  air  near  the  surface  of  our  earth  possesses  a \nspace  about  1200  times  greater  than  water  of  the  same  weight ;  and  there \nfore  a  cylindric  column  of  air  1200  feet  high  is  of  equal  weight  with  a \ncylinder  of  water  of  the  same  breadth,  and  but  one  foot  high. But  a \ncylinder  of  air  reaching  to  the  top  of  the  atmosphere  is  of  equal  weight \nwith  a  cylinder  of  water  about  33  feet  high  ;  and  therefore  if  from  the \nwhole  cylinder  of  air  the  lower  part  of  1200  feet  high  is  taken  away,  the \nremaining  upper  part  will  be  of  equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of  water  32 \nfeet  high.

Wherefore  the  distance  of  the  comet  from  the  earth  cannot  exceed \nthe  interval  TA. nor  its  distance  from  the  sun  the  interval  SA  beyond,  or \nST  on  this  side  the  sun.

There  are  three  hypotheses  about  comets  (p. 466) ;  for  some  will  have  it \nthat  they  are  generated  and  perish  as  often  as  they  appear  and  vanish ; \nothers,  that  they  come  from  the  regions  of  the  rixed  stars,  and  are  seen  by \nus  in  their  passage  through  the  system  of  our  planets ;  and,  lastly,  others, \nthat  they  are  bodies  perpetually  revolving  about  the  sun  in  very  eccentric \norbits.

VII,  Prop. XVI) ;  and, \nby  my  computation,  the  velocity  of  comets  is  found  to  be  much  about \nthe  same.

The  small  difference  of  7\u00a3u. in  this  rude  way  of  computing  is  to  be  neg \nlected,  and  perhaps  may  arise  from  the  comet's  motion  being  some  small \nmatter  slower,  as  it  must  have  been  if  the  true  orbit  in  which  it  was  car \nried  was  an  ellipsis. The  middle  time  between  its  ingress  and  egress  was \nDecember  Sd. 21'. of  the  morning ;  and  therefore  at  this  time  the  comet \nought  to  have  been  in  its  perihelion. And  accordingly  that  very  day,  just \nbefore  sunrising,  Dr. Halley  (as  we  said)  saw  the  tail  short  and  broad,  but- \nvery  bright,  rising  perpendicularly  from  the  horizon. From  the  position \nof  the  tail  it  is  certain  that  the  comet  had  then  crossed  over  the  ecliptic, \nand  got  into  north  latitude,  and  therefore  had  passed  by  its  perihelion, \nwhich  lay  on  the  other  side  of  the  ecliptic,  though  it  had  not  yet  come  into \nconjunction  with  the  sun  ;  and  the  comet  [see  more  of  this  famous  comet, \np.", "ome  into \nconjunction  with  the  sun  ;  and  the  comet  [see  more  of  this  famous  comet, \np. 475  to  486]  being  at  this  time  between  its  perihelion  and  its  conjunc \ntion  with  the  sun,  must  have  been  in  its  perihelion  a  few  hours  before; \nfor  in  so  near  a  distance  from  the  sun  it  must  have  been  carried  with  great \nvelocity,  and  have  apparently  described  almost  half  a  degree  every  hour. By  like  computations  I  find  that  the  comet  of  1618  entered  the  sphere \nof  the  orbis  maxims  December  7,  towards  sun-setting ;  but  its  conjunc \ntion  with  the  sun  was  Nov. 9,  or  10,  about  28  days  intervening,  as  in  the \npreceding  comet ;  for  from  the  size  of  the  tail  of  this,  in  wtrch  it  was \nequal  to  the  preceding,  it  is  probable  that  this  comet  likewise  did  come \nalmost  into  a  contact  with  the  sun. Four  comets  were  seen  that  year  of \nwhich  this  was  the  last. The  second,  which  made  its  first  appearance \nOctober  31,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  rising  sun,  and  was  soon  after  hid \nunder  the  sun's  rays,  1  suspect  to  have  been  the  same  with  the  fourth, \nwhich  emerged  out  of  the  sun's  rays  about  Nov. 9. To  these  we  may  add \nthe  comet  of  1607,  which  entered  the  sphere  of  the  orbis  mi^-tnis  Sept. 14,  O.S.", "add \nthe  comet  of  1607,  which  entered  the  sphere  of  the  orbis  mi^-tnis  Sept. 14,  O.S. and  arrived  at  its  perihelion  distance  from  the  sun  about  October \n19,  35  days  intervening. Its  perihelion  distance  subtended  an  apparent \nangle  at  the  earth  of  about  23  degrees,  and  was  therefore  of  390  parts. And  to  this  number  of  parts  about  34  days  correspond  in  Tab. 1 .

Its  perihelion  distance  subtended  an  angle  at  the  earth  of  about  seven \ndegrees,  and  therefore  was  of  122  parts  :  and  corresponding  to  this  number \nof  parts,  in  Tab. 1,  we  find  30  days.

I,  belong  33^  days. Lastly  ;  that  memorable  comet  of \nRegiomontanus,  which  in  1472  was  carried  through  the  circum-polar \nparts  of  our  northern  hemisphere  with  such  rapidity  as  to  describe  40", "566 \nTHE    SYSTEM    OF    THE   WORLD. degrees  in  one  day,  entered  the  sphere  of  the  orbis  magnus  Jan  21,  abonl \nthe  time  that  it  was  passing  by  the  pole,  and,  hastening  from  them* \ntowards  the  sun,  was  hid  under  the  sun's  rays  about  the  end  of  Feb. , \nwhence  it  is  probable  that  30  days,  or  a  few  more,  were  spent  between  its \ningress  into  the  sphere  of  the  orbis  magnus  and  its  perihelion. Nor  did \nthis  comet  truly  move  with  more  velocity  than  other  comets,  but  owed  the \ngreatness  of  its  apparent  velocity  to  its  passing  by  the  earth  at  a  near \ndistance. It  appears,  then,  that  the  velocity  of  comets  (p. 471),  so  far  as  it  can  be \ndetermined  by  these  rude  ways  of  computing,  is  that  very  velocity  with \nwhich  parabolas,  or  ellipses  near  to  parabolas,  ought  to  be  described;  and \ntherefore  the  distance  between  a  comet  and  the  sun  being  given,  the  velocity \nof  the  comet  is  nearly  given. And  hence  arises  this  problem. 4  PROBLEM.

If  this  problem  was  resolved,  we  should  thence  have  a  method  of  deter \nmining  the  trajectories  of  comets  to  the  greatest  accuracy :  for  if  that  re \nlation  be  twice  assumed,  and  from  thence  the  trajectory  be  twice  computed, \nand  the  error  of  each  trajectory  be  found  from  observations,  the  assumption \nmay  be  corrected  by  the  Rule  of  False,  and  a  third  trajectory  may  thence \nbe  found  that  will  exactly  agree  with  the  observations.
